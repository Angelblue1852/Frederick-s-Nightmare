 NAP_reinforce_the_national_militias_desc:0 "The Neapolitan armed forces have traditionally been a militarily weak amalgamation of various regional state troopers, with an important division between Neapolitan and Sicilian forces. The Staracists tried to make up for this with the establishment of a secondary military, the 'milizie nazionale'. These national militias are a paramilitary strike force loyal to the party rather than the country."
 NAP_compact_with_wurttemberg:0 "Compact with Württemberg"
 NAP_compact_with_wurttemberg_desc:0 "Military problems are in Naples often connected to diplomatic ones. As most military activity in the world is tied to various great powers and the dealings of their respective military-industrial complexes, it has been difficult for Neapolitan businessmen to make decisive ties with foreign military leaderships - particularly due to Franco-Austrian disdain. Württemberg, the German fascists, could be a solution."
 NAP_ideological_officers:0 "Ideological Officers"
 NAP_ideological_officers_desc:0 "Due to a recent purge of the army leadership in May of 1935, many Neapolitan generals have been forced into retirement or exile. Although a pro-Staracist clique around Giovanni Messe survived the cleansing, it is clear that Naples will need new commanders rather soon. It is of key importance to have these commanders both militarily and ideologically educated in the proper way."
 NAP_doctrinal_reform:0 "Doctrinal Reform"
 NAP_doctrinal_reform_desc:0 "The central position of strong and well-designed military doctrine cannot be overstated. The Neapolitan military, split between Giovanni Messe's favor towards armored formations and Antonio Sorice's dreams of planned attacks by prepared units, has failed to make any particular advances in military doctrine where other countries are racing ahead. The decision between two schools will have to be made."
