 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 CAN_1936_DESC:0 "Quebec has been France's most formidable colonial success story. The victory in the Great War saw the annexiation of most of British Canada, and Quebec has continuously conquered new frontiers in the west, including the purchase of Alaska from Russia during the first Bolshevik insurgency of 1896. While Franco-Canadian nationalists demand territorial gains at the Amerindien's expense, the Anglo-Canadian minority is more interested in a more complete equality before the law and proper consideration of Anglo-Canadian civil rights."
 USA_1936_DESC:0 "Liberty was a costly expense. It took the American colonists two tries to achieve sovereignity from Britain and independence has not been kind with the U.S. either. Western expansion is prevented by the French colonial empire. The recent acquisition of the Panama Canal marks an increase in American relevance, but the republic has a long way to go. The constant two-way political squabbling between Whigs and Democrats, with the more liberal Whigs currently in the White House with their young President Wadsworth, is not helpful to the overall political climate."
 MEX_1936_DESC:0 "Ever since the communist coup in 1883, Mexico has been the forerunner of Latin American socialism and its longlasting rivalry with the 'eurocommunist' Italian and Spanish communist colonies. Mexico is closely aligned with the Caribbean Confederation, which it in 1885 undermined to also undergo a communist revolution, bringing the "Central American Republic" to a definitive end. Nowadays, the Indian-born Manabendra Nath Roy is primarily concerned with resurgent American nationalism in the north and the unruly democratic movements supported by Guatemala in the south."

 OHI_1936_DESC:0 "Created as a weird historical compromise between the French and British monarchies after the British Revolution, the "Kingdom of Ohio" hosts what Ohio itself calls 'the last remnant of the British Empire'. A personal fiefdom of the British kings given to them by the French kings, the creation of Ohio was an initial doublestrike by the French king to both improve relations with the newly created British republic and to enable themselves to overthrow it with the help of the former British royal house."
