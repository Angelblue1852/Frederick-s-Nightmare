 1936_NAME:0 "Gathering Conflict"
 1936_DESC:0 "The Great War of 1763 has thoroughly shaped the world we live in. France, the dominant world power, sits comfortably on every continent of the world with its colonial empire. Austria and Russia have carved up eastern Europe, much to the dismay of Prussia and the Ottoman Empire. The British Republic, more envious of French success than ever, is waiting across the English Channels with a massive navy, but without the army to back up its ambition."
 #Major Powers
 AUS_1936_DESC:0 "The Austrian Vielvölkerstaat has grown ever more unstable. The various ethnicities of the empire, first and foremost the Hungarians, are in a constant state of agitation towards the central authority of Vienna. Emperor Franz Ferdinand has so far not done much to change the reactionary policies of his reactionary uncle Franz Joseph, who abdicated in 1915."
 CHI_1936_DESC:0 "China looks back on a century of humiliation. An international alliance consisting of Spain, Prussia, Sweden and France forced its way into China's markets in the 1820s. Each of these powers have established colonial cities on China's shoreline - but none of them are as big of a menace as the Japanese Empire, which defeated China and absorbed parts of her territory in two recent conflicts. The Chinese 'self-strengthening movement', an ultra nationalistic wing of the Kuomintang, has promised to make China glorious again."
 ENG_1936_DESC:0 "Ever since the downfall of George III in the British Revolution of 1810, Britain has been a strong and proud republic - but it has not been a strong and proud colonial empire. Largely pushed out of North America after the Great War, Britain did not only lose the United States during the revolution, it was also denied access to China by the other colonial empires before being forced to give up African ambitions in order to please Britain's only major ally, Prussia. While some colonies have been established in the South Pacific and on the Arabian Peninsula, the overall situation just will not do."
 FRA_1936_DESC:0 "If international diplomacy is a lottery, France has won the main prize. A massive colonial empire, a well-established home country, and a political system strengthened through political reform rather than violent revolution. But France has grown complacent. Its colonial subjects are demanding greater amounts of autonomy, the Germans and Dutch under French dominion want independence. The French-led military alliance, the Entente, has been without a major direction except for 'whatever France wants', much to the dismay of France's allies."
 PRS_1936_DESC:0 "Surrounded by hostile great powers, Prussia was denied the status among the world elite it hoped to establish in the Great War. Having lost both Silesia and Germany as a whole to the Austrians, having lost influence with the western German states to the French and having lost influence in Poland to the Russians, Prussia has not been well. Imitating French political reform, Prussia has liberalized its system and has establihsed a minor colonial empire - but that does not give it the desired world power status, does it?"
 SOV_1936_DESC:0 "If every person was given a free wish, Tsar Nicholas II would probably wish to be less hated by his own people. Russia has maintained a massive military force to protect her borders from foreign threats, but while doing so has recruited a massive amount of revolutionarily minded bolsheviks into her army. The Russian secret services are noticing that people like Lenin and Trotzky are more popular with especially the lower classes than the Tsar is. Russia, still holding onto the concept of the divine mandate, might have to liberalize or to face a bloody communist uprising."
 TUR_1936_DESC:0 "Recently, the nickname 'sick man on the bosphorus' has gotten popular when talking about the Ottoman Turks. The Empire was forced to let go of Romania, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece in the Austro-Turkish War of 1881 to 1883, an Austrian military invasion in support of several Slavic and Greek uprisings in the region endorsed by France and Britain. France has since taken an even more hostile stance, supporting the Egyptian Revolt of 1919 and forcing the Turks to give up their Egyptian territory."
 #Minors
 CAN_1936_DESC:0 "Quebec has been France's most formidable colonial success story. The victory in the Great War saw the annexiation of most of British Canada, and Quebec has continuously conquered new frontiers in the west, including the purchase of Alaska from Russia during the first Bolshevik insurgency of 1896. While Franco-Canadian nationalists demand territorial gains at Confederate expense, the Anglo-Canadian minority is more interested in a more complete equality before the law and proper consideration of Anglo-Canadian civil rights. The Quebec Self-Determination Act of 1924 practically gained Quebec its independence from France."
 ITA_1936_DESC:0 "A united' Italy' is more an idea in the mind of dreamers than a political fact. Radical left-wing forces have taken control of the 'Italian' government in Bologna, while Naples is run by ultra nationalistic forces and the center of the peninsula remains firmly in the hands of the authoritarian pope and his cronies. Add to that Austrian control in the north east and the result is an utterly non-united united nation. Italy, the product of French meddling in anti-Austrian diplomacy in the late 19th Century, now stands merely by the side of Spain."
 JAP_1936_DESC:0 "Japan has defeated China twice in the last 40 years. Having taken control of Formosa, Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula, the Japanese Empire with its beloved Emperor Hirohito has taken a prime spot among the powers of the world - or so Japan would like to think. Resources are scarce and the population is growing. Many nations refuse to affiliate with the Japanese state because of its foreign policy. Japan will have to prove itself."
 MEX_1936_DESC:0 "Ever since the communist coup in 1883, Mexico has been the forerunner of Latin American socialism and its longlasting rivalry with the 'eurocommunist' Italian and Spanish communist colonies. Mexico is closely aligned with the Caribbean Confederation, which it in 1885 undermined to also undergo a communist revolution, bringing the "Central American Republic" to a definitive end. Nowadays, the Indian-born Manabendra Nath Roy is primarily concerned with resurgent American nationalism in the north and the unruly democratic movements supported by Guatemala in the south."
 NAP_1936_DESC:0 "Safe from the French project to unite northern Italy under one (now communist) banner, Naples for a long time developed as a strong independent kingdom on the southern end of the peninsula, with Sicily and Naples as co-equal federated provinces under one Neapolitan king. In December of 1923, a government crisis did however prove an opening to the "Revolutionary Fascists" of Achille Starace to seize power in the country by taking the royal family hostage."
 OHI_1936_DESC:0 "Created as a weird historical compromise between the French and British monarchies after the British Revolution, the "Kingdom of Ohio" hosts what Ohio itself calls 'the last remnant of the British Empire'. A personal fiefdom of the British kings given to them by the French kings, the creation of Ohio was an initial doublestrike by the French king to both improve relations with the newly created British republic and to enable themselves to overthrow it with the help of the former British royal house."
 PAP_1936_DESC:0 "Kept alive as a political power between Togliatti's communists to the north and Starace's fascists to the south purely by the diplomatic protection of the two great Catholic powers that are France and Austria, the pope and his Papal States represent the weakest of the three Italian entities - and the one where ideological change seems the least likely. The Catholic Church is accepted as the dominant force in the country, but that could change if the Pope decides to stop following his own preachings of peace and cooperation."
 SWE_1936_DESC:0 "Sweden had taken a gamble when supporting the Franco-Austrian alliance during the Great War, but the gamble paid off. Sweden now holds colonies in China, India and Africa, but its claim to supremacy in northern Europe is still inhibited by Prussian and Russian influence to the south and the east. Sweden, very francophile in its political spectrum and ideology, had long considered joining the Entente, but each debate had always seen the isolationists win and neutrality persist. But with the threat of a Bolshevik revolution on her eastern border, Sweden must more than ever consider getting back in the action."
 USA_1936_DESC:0 "Liberty was a costly expense. It took the American colonists two tries to achieve sovereignity from Britain and independence has not been kind with the U.S. either. Western expansion is prevented by the French colonial empire. The recent acquisition of the Panama Canal marks an increase in American relevance, but the republic has a long way to go. The constant two-way political squabbling between Democrats and Republicans, with the more liberal Republicans currently in the White House with their young President Wadsworth, is not helpful to the overall political climate."
