 SOV_finish_the_tsar_line:0 "Finish the Tsar Line"
 SOV_finish_the_tsar_line_desc:0 "The "Tsar Line" is an ambitious project by the Russian government that was started in 1927, trying to connect Petrograd, Novgorod, Moscow, Voronezh, Rostov and Tsaritsyn with a massive double-track railway. While mostly finished in the urban areas, the rural parts remain vacant - and not for lack of resources, as all rails have been assembled already. It is merely a question of putting them in place."
 SOV_expand_the_capital_industry:0 "Expand the Capital Industry"
 SOV_expand_the_capital_industry_desc:0 "The Tsarist capital city at Petrograd is the center of the North Russian economy, uniting civilian, military and naval industrial sectors. It will be relatively easy to pull foreign investors to back projects in that area of the country compared to Russia's more remote regions in the countryside."
 SOV_black_sea_ports:0 "Black Sea Ports"
 SOV_black_sea_ports_desc:0 "The Black Sea holds a historical importance to all of Russia, as it is the most easily accessible naval body that is not threatened by permanent freezing during winter times. Russia's hold on this strategically invaluable position cannot be jeopardized."
 SOV_siberian_exploitation:0 "Siberian Exploitation"
 SOV_siberian_exploitation_desc:0 "The natural resources of Siberia are the only factor that make the region interesting in the greater picture of the Russian power scheme. There are still many untapped locations in the vast wilderness of Russia's northern frontier, and only who finds them can claim the spoils for themselves."
 SOV_expand_moscow_factories:0 "Expand Moscow Factories"
 SOV_expand_moscow_factories_desc:0 "Moscow, due to its central location inside the Russian railway line, has grown into the country's perhaps most important industrial center, even more so than the capital city itself. Transporting resources, refined goods and personnel in and out of Moscow is easier and less time consuming than with cities closer to any one of Russia's many borders - and thus, Russian industrialists insist that any economic or military industrial efforts have to have Moscow in mind."

 SOV_fund_the_imperial_universities:0 "Fund the Imperial Universities"
 SOV_fund_the_imperial_universities_desc:0 "Education is a field in which Russia has always lacked behind its more advanced rivals to the west. Several central schools, called the "Imperial Universities" due to their historical connection with the tsarist regime, have distinguished themselves as being able to somewhat hold step with the massive education monoliths in New York City, Paris, Berlin, London and other top-class cities of the world. Russia should give extra care to these universities to enable the best and the brightest of her youth."

 SOV_partial_concessions_to_the_duma:0 "Partial Concessions to the Duma"
 SOV_partial_concessions_to_the_duma_desc:0 "The position of the Tsar has been threatened for decades due to the low legitimacy that the Tsarist rule has among the revolution-minded Russian people. It is necessary for now to relinquish parts of Tsarist autocracy and to give token concessions to the Russian parliament, the Duma."
 SOV_legalize_unions:0 "Legalize Unions"
 SOV_legalize_unions_desc:0 "Workers inside the imperial Russian state have historically been denied the right to form political labor unions due to the internal security concerns connected to such a movement. Since serfdom being abolished in 1882, the imperial government tried to keep the working class on a short leash, but it is clearly bad for morale and is a policy that needs to be revised."
 SOV_investigate_the_bolshevik_conspiracy:0 "Investigate the Bolshevik Conspiracy"
 SOV_investigate_the_bolshevik_conspiracy_desc:0 "In August of 1935, a razzia in Moscow that became famous as the "August Raid" busted the illegal proceedings of Mikhail Tomsky, the city's aristocratically appointed mayor. Tomsky had secretly formed a pact with the local Bolsheviks in the anticipation of an imminent fourth revolution. Since the August Raid (and Tomsky's execution), the Russian secret services have been anxious to further investigate the ties between low-level local politicians as well as members of the judiciary and the communists looking to overthrow the system."

 SOV_declare_state_atheism_desc:0 "For way too long has Russia held on to outdated religious beliefs and even more outdated pseudo-moralistic connections between state and church. Before fighting religious influence among the populous, we need to first get it out of government. Vladimir Lenin outlined a concept of "state atheism", a hyper-radical form of secular government. It is time to realize his plans at last."
