 ENG_midlands_investments:0 "Midlands Investments"
 ENG_midlands_investments_desc:0 "The Midlands have recently seen a bit of an economic recession, with several private steel manufacturing companies pulling out of the region. We could revitalize steel production and bring back jobs by putting incentives for companies to fill the voids left by their predecessors."
 ENG_national_oil_projects:0 "National Oil Projects"
 ENG_national_oil_projects_desc:0 "In a landmark speech, noted anti-monarchist and statesman Neville Chamberlain argued "The British empire's main weakness is its lack of a notable petroleum output". Whether or not he is correct is up for debate, but we could adopt his sentiment into government doctrine regardless in order to silence skeptics to our new resource funding programs."
 ENG_northern_economic_expansion:0 "Northern Economic Expansion"
 ENG_northern_economic_expansion_desc:0 "Scotland and northern England have been hit rather hard by economic downturn in 1926, also leading to a lot of support for the AoNF, Radical Labour and other extremists in the area. We should try to cater to these citizens in order to guide them back to our glorious government doctrine."
 ENG_north_sea_oil_production:0 "North Sea Oil Production"
 ENG_north_sea_oil_production_desc:0 "Our first step towards sufficient oil production should be to maximize the output of our home islands - colonial oil is well and good, but can be cut off from us by the French. The North Sea might be rich in oil deposits, if we can only secure them."
 ENG_reform_the_colonial_ministry:0 "Reform the Colonial Ministry"
 ENG_reform_the_colonial_ministry_desc:0 "Although Britain was robbed of a great colonial potential by French interference, the Republic has nonetheless managed to acquire colonial possessions in the South Atlantic, on the Arabian peninsula and in South East Asia and Oceania. Our Secretary for the Colonies is one of Britain's most powerful and important statesmen, but his ministry is rotten and in dire need of reform."
 ENG_southern_economic_expansion:0 "Southern Economic Expansion"
 ENG_southern_economic_expansion_desc:0 "While not hit nearly as hard by economic hardship as the northern part of the island, the south of Great Britain still could need a little push to its economy to get the factories working at full speed again."
 ENG_irish_sea_oil_production:0 "Irish Sea Oil Production"
 ENG_irish_sea_oil_production_desc:0 "Although not nearly as impressive as the North Sea's potential, the possibility of turning the Irish Sea into a source of British petroleum has the added benefit of being better shielded from foreign invasion due to the geographic features of the British west coast as compared to its east coast."
 ENG_fortify_yemen:0 "Fortify Yemen"
 ENG_fortify_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen is one of Britain's more vital and delicate colonial possessions, holding the only major port of the Arabian peninsula that is ever so vulnerable to French aggression from the Suez Canal or Djibouti. Delegating additional funds to secure our colonial garrisons in Yemen is a logical step."
 ENG_pass_the_singapore_decree:0 "Pass the Singapore Decree"
 ENG_pass_the_singapore_decree_desc:0 "Unclear wording in the colonial laws had left most of the British East Asian colonies under the control of the semi-autonomous Australian government, which did not exactly do well for the economy. The Australians have begun putting their own taxes and tariffs on top of the British ones, stifling prosperity in regions Britain might want to have all the revenues from. This especially holds true for Singapore."
 ENG_persian_gulf_oil_production:0 "Persian Gulf Oil Production"
 ENG_persian_gulf_oil_production_desc:0 "Great Britain's oil production is now at the point where any forced expansion would be utterly unprofitable. It is now time to attempt a push into our colonial territories. The Persian Gulf and the British-held adjacent coast lines might turn out to be among the world's richest oil regions. We just need to find the black gold."
 ENG_fortify_oman:0 "Fortify Oman"
 ENG_fortify_oman_desc:0 "After securing Yemen, expanding our military outreach up the Arabian coast to Oman should be sufficient to both further fortify our position on the peninsula and to also remind the Iranians that we are here and that we are still looking for oil."
 ENG_construct_singapore_military_yard:0 "Construct Singapore Military Yard"
 ENG_construct_singapore_military_yard_desc:0 "After securing Singapore for ourselves, we are faced with several promising economic and tactical possibilities. Singapore is so rich in resources that it becomes economically ineffective to ship out everything at once towards our factories. We could instead try to build factories close to the source of all those South East Asian riches - that would be fantastic."
 ENG_arabian_desert_expedition:0 "Arabian Desert Expedition"
 ENG_arabian_desert_expedition_desc:0 "The Arabian Peninsula remains largely unchartered when it comes to the heartlands. These deserts may be hiding black riches the likes of which even France would not dare to dream of. Sure, pushing into the territories the Saudis claim for themselves will annoy the Arabs, but who cares about a few camel lovers living between the butt cheeks of the Ottoman Empire?"
 ENG_fortify_the_trucial_states:0 "Fortify the Trucial States"
 ENG_fortify_the_trucial_states_desc:0 "To secure our new found wealth on the Persian Gulf Coast and to further our territorial ambition against the Saudis and Ottomans, we should slowly begin pushing our fortifications up the Persian Gulf coast of the peninsula."
 ENG_challenge_the_saudis:0 "Challenge the Saudis"
 ENG_challenge_the_saudis_desc:0 "Saudi Arabia is a strategic obstacle to the British people: They are sitting on oil that should obviously be ours and they are stopping us from "being close" to our "friends", the Ottoman Empire. Considering the Arabs are worthless savages that don't even comprehend the Anglican Church's merry messages, it should be no issue to convince the British parliament to order a military expedition into the Nejd."
 ENG_support_the_zionists:0 "Support the Zionists"
 ENG_support_the_zionists_desc:0 "Jews. Many people hate them, they don't even have a state and they are not really a united force to begin with. But with the Zionists, there has started to be a concept of "Jewish Nationalism", with one of the main goals being the liberation of the Jewish holy land from the Turks. Sure, the Jewish holy land is also holy to islam, but surely, voicing non-nuanced support for the Jewish cause would never cause tensions!"
 ENG_support_the_iraqi_nationalists:0 "Support the Iraqi Nationalists"
 ENG_support_the_iraqi_nationalists_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire is a dangerous imperialistic state. Sure, the same thing can be said about Britain, but Britain is Christian and Anglo-Saxon, hence imperialism is clearly justified. Sometimes, imperialism is not about taking land however, it's about making your rivals lose theirs. Having an Iraqi state independent from the Ottomans would be a fantastic idea."
 ENG_challenge_the_ottomans:0 "Challenge the Ottomans"
 ENG_challenge_the_ottomans_desc:0 "We have successfully allied with Jewish nationalists and Iraqi independence fighters. We should prepare to strike the Levant region of the Ottoman Empire immediately - Jerusalem and Baghdad shall be ours in no time!"
 ENG_pass_the_home_defense_act:0 "Pass the Home Defense Act"
 ENG_pass_the_home_defense_act_desc:0 "The British Republican Army is one consisting entirely of volunteers since the draft was 'temporarily halted' in 1894. Re-enacting conscription should send the signal to the world that Britain at last is willing and ready to reclaim what is rightfully hers."
 ENG_construct_manchester_military_yard:0 "Construct Manchester Military Yard"
 ENG_construct_manchester_military_yard_desc:0 "Much of Britain's industrial base is in the center and north of England, hence it is only logical to bless that region with additional armament companies to supply the glorious British army with glorious British material."
 ENG_pass_the_technological_advancements_act:0 "Pass the Technological Advancements Act"
 ENG_pass_the_technological_advancements_act_desc:0 "While making war and charging into battle is without a doubt a fun and gentlemanly way to spend one's evening, sometimes it is also good to sit back and consider whether or not it is perhaps time to mind the economy for once. Our research teams' complaints about lack of government funding has caused [ENG.GetRulingParty] members to present the Technological Advancements Act to advance the nation."
 ENG_pass_the_currency_reform_act:0 "Pass the Currency Reform Act"

 ENG_construct_edinburgh_military_yard_desc:0 "WIP"
 ENG_air_force_innovations:0 "Air Force Innovations"
 ENG_air_force_innovations_desc:0 "With the British Navy a force to behold, it seems unlikely that any enemy with the possible exception of France would engage Britain at sea. The next logical step for such a theoretical enemy would be to regularly cross the English Channel with bomber squadrons and to bomb enemy cities. The British Air Force needs to be prepared and ready for such an air war."
 ENG_radar_innovations:0 "Radar Innovations"
 ENG_radar_innovations_desc:0 "RADAR, short for "radio detection and ranging", is a promising new technology of the future that has gotten attention particularly in the United States, but to the same degree in Britain as well. Radar Stations could be the basis of any future aerial conflict, and Britain cannot afford to lose control of her valuable airspace."
 ENG_pass_the_great_britain_air_defense_act:0 "Pass the Great Britain Air Defense Act"
 ENG_pass_the_great_britain_air_defense_act_desc:0 "The Air Force has repeatedly complained about too much hassle dealing with local bureaucrats and rural administrators about constructing airfields, anti-aircraft batteries and radar stations. We should pass a legislation package to give our air force leadership a higher amount of leverage in such instances of civil dispute."
 ENG_channel_coast_radar_system:0 "Channel Coast Radar System"
 ENG_channel_coast_radar_system_desc:0 "Securing the British Isles from an enemy incursion by air has to be our main concern. Several European powers, France and Austria chief among them, have begun assembling massive air forces in order to secure the battlefields of the future. Britain, while also expanding her air force, has seen pushes to a more pragmatic technology-backed air defense system including anti-air guns and RADAR stations."
 ENG_operation_south_wind:0 "Operation South Wind"
 ENG_operation_south_wind_desc:0 "Britain is finally in shape to challenge the world's tyrant, France. The preparations to cross the English channel have been dubbed 'Operation South Wind' by the plan's main author, John Vereker. It is at last the time to prepare our navies to guide our armies across the English Channel, the waterway that was our oldest ally for so long, and to strike the French when they least expect it."
 ENG_settle_the_score:0 "Settle the Score"
 ENG_settle_the_score_desc:0 "Operation South Wind, the invasion of France, is planned and ready. It is at last time to take vengeance for two centuries of humiliations at French hands."
 ENG_expand_liverpool_naval_yard:0 "Expand Liverpool Naval Yard"
 ENG_expand_liverpool_naval_yard_desc:0 "The British Republican Navy's main production site for warships is situated at Liverpool in northern England. Expanding the Liverpool Harbour naval yard will shape the British Republican Navy into a menace that even the French naval forces could not possibly counter."
 ENG_battleship_strategy:0 "Battleship Strategy"
 ENG_battleship_strategy_desc:0 "The time has come to decide on our naval strategy. The British navy should focus on battleship construction in the future - the recent experimentation with aircraft carriers has clearly proven to be a 'worthless and expensive gamble', as Andrew Cunningham put in a recent meeting of the naval staff."
 ENG_submarine_strategy:0 "Submarine Strategy"
 ENG_submarine_strategy_desc:0 "The Prussian admiral Karl Dönitz has developed a very interesting approach to naval warfare: Avoid direct confrontation, ambush enemy ships and destroy their convoys. To do that, a country needs a massive submarine force. While some British admirals call this 'underseas endeavour' heretical and stupid when considering that Britain very much has an overseas fleet, we have to consider all possibilities."
 ENG_carrier_strategy:0 "Carrier Strategy"
 ENG_carrier_strategy_desc:0 "The British Republic was the first country to truly endorse the idea of a carrier-based war fleet. Both the BRS Borussia and the BRS Britannia are strong and proud reminders - especially to the French - that Britain cannot be messed with. But the situation in war has somewhat changed: France has secretly assembled three aircraft carriers, outnumbering our two! We need to get even and race back ahead!"
 ENG_the_southern_strategy:0 "The Southern Strategy"
 ENG_the_southern_strategy_desc:0 "Britain needs to acknowledge that the primary danger to its independence is France - and specifically French invasion across the channel. The British army is formidable, but it cannot stand up to the French one. That is why any invasion attempt must be at the latest be repelled at the beaches of southern England - allowing the French to take the fight inland would mark the end of the republic."
 ENG_cruiser_innovations:0 "Cruiser Innovations"
 ENG_cruiser_innovations_desc:0 "Cruisers were traditionally the backbone of the British navy. While the destroyer has taken over at least part of that function, the cruiser's importance still can hardly be overstated. Filling roles for which the battleship is too bulky and the destroyer too weak, the cruiser remains one of the vital lifelines of the Navy."
 ENG_destroyer_innovations:0 "Destroyer Innovations"
 ENG_destroyer_innovations_desc:0 "WIP"
 ENG_additional_naval_doctrines:0 "Additional Naval Doctrines"
 ENG_additional_naval_doctrines_desc:0 "The specialization of the navy is progressing well, but the admirals have reported a worrying decline in the speed our reforms are being implementend. Reigniting the vigor with which the navy sees to these changes could be vital to the war effort."
 ENG_battleship_innovations:0 "Battleship Innovations"
 ENG_battleship_innovations_desc:0 "Renovating 'Britain's Old Glory', the battleship fleet, has to be one of the Navy's main concerns for the future. Settling on battleships as the main naval force is well and good, but acknowledging their downsides is even more important than with Carriers or Submarines. Having an entire battleship sunk by a lonely torpedo or bomb would be highly embarassing to say the least."
 ENG_submarine_innovations:0 "Submarine Innovations"
 ENG_submarine_innovations_desc:0 "Striking from beneath the seas scaring even the biggest and proudest of warships, submarines have been viewed as somewhat of a dirty strategy to defend the oceans. Several naval thinkers from various countries, including Dönitz from Britain's traditional ally Prussia, have held fascinating talks about the future importance and the military potential of these undersea boats."
 ENG_carrier_innovations:0 "Carrier Innovations"
 ENG_carrier_innovations_desc:0 "The Borussia and the Britannia are the pride of our navy - not only are they visually breathtaking, they are able to deliver deadly airpower from a foreign shore directly onto a foreign city."
 ENG_reform_parliament:0 "Reform Parliament"
 ENG_reform_parliament_desc:0 "Ramsay MacDonald's administration has made several mistakes in the past term, including an implied alliance with the Radical Labour Party on several economic issues that has greatly tarnished the reputation of the British Republicans both at home and abroad. Now, with several democratic MPs deserting in favor of conservative factions, parliament is in need of reform to break the deadlocks."
 ENG_end_the_macdonald_administration:0 "End the MacDonald Administration"
 ENG_end_the_macdonald_administration_desc:0 "It is clear that the BRP needs time to recover from the current political controversies. While the British Republicans rethink their public image, the largely uncontroversial Deputy Prime Minister, the war hero Herbert Morrison, can guide the country. MacDonald meanwhile can enjoy his well-earned retirement."
 ENG_hand_power_to_the_conservatives:0 "Hand Power to the Conservatives"
 ENG_hand_power_to_the_conservatives_desc:0 "The British Republican Party needs to give ground to its internal right wing, the 'United Kingslayers and Independent Parliamentarians' faction, or UKIP for short. The UKIP faction has long demanded that the BRP is reformed into the 'BCU', the British Conservative Union, which is to ally with several reactionary factions in parliament in order to counteract the Radical Labour Party in the house."
 ENG_ally_with_the_radicals:0 "Ally with the Radicals"
 ENG_ally_with_the_radicals_desc:0 "The British Republican Party needs to yield to its internal left-wingers, the BRP Labour Activist Pact. The LAPs, as they are sometimes called, advocate a permanent alliance of the BRP with the RLP and to replace Morrison with the RLP leader James Maxton as Prime Minister."
 ENG_the_anglican_tax:0 "The Anglican Tax"
 ENG_the_anglican_tax_desc:0 "One of James Maxton's main political talking point has always been collecting taxes on the profits of religious institutions as if they were private businesses (which he refers to as "The Anglican Tax"), as well as the replacement of creationist school curricula with a focus on evolutionary theories and modern biology."
