 GER_military_focus:0 "Military Focus"
 GER_military_focus_desc:0 "Voltaire once said "Where some states have an army, the Prussian Army has a state.".\nThe Army has always been one of Prussia's biggest strongpoints and the sole reason the country is still able to defend itself even after the humiliations of the past."
 GER_marineplan_doenitz:0 "Marineplan Dönitz"
 GER_marineplan_doenitz_desc:0 "Prussia has always put a focus on its land power, with a multitude of army generals insisting over the years that any spending on the navy takes away from the potential land force. Karl Dönitz, supreme commander of the tiny Prussian navy, has proposed in the past a transition to a more effective and more cost-efficient submarine-based force."
 GER_expand_the_general_staff:0 "Expand the General Staff"
 GER_expand_the_general_staff_desc:0 "A German soldier is only as good as his commanding officer, and a commanding officer is only as good as the general overseeing him. The Otto Wels administration has successfully implemented a program based on merit rather than heritage in the past; it is now time to extend that program and gain an even bigger and more effective leadership pool for the fighting force."
 GER_support_the_lohmeyer_plan:0 "Support the Lohmeyer-Plan"
 GER_support_the_lohmeyer_plan_desc:0 "Hans Lohmeyer, mayor of Königsberg in East Prussia, has proposed the continued integration of his state and his city in particular into the Prussian defensive preparations in case of Russian invasion. So far, Prussian planning had assumed East Prussia would have to be surrendered due to the strategic encirclement, but perhaps the Lohmeyer plan can amend this disadvantage."
 GER_promote_additional_admirals:0 "Promote Additional Admirals"
 GER_promote_additional_admirals_desc:0 "With the recent elevation of several generals into the central general staff of the Prussian Army, Karl Dönitz has requested the formation of a naval central staff by promoting a select number of naval officers into the admiralty. Previously, the Prussian Army had enforced that only one admiral could serve in the navy at any time, but with the new generalships, promotion of new admirals seem only fair."
 GER_invest_in_koenigsberg_artillery:0 "Invest in Königsberg Artillery"
 GER_invest_in_koenigsberg_artillery_desc:0 "Königsberg has been central to the creation of medium and heavy howitzers of the Prussian Army since the early 1920s, when several artillery manufacturers formed the Königsberg Artillery conglomerate in and around the city. Lohmeyer has suggested that Königsberg Artillery should take a central spot in our defensive inclusion efforts in East Prussia."
 GER_expand_north_sea_ports:0 "Expand North Sea Ports"
 GER_expand_north_sea_ports_desc:0 "Although Prussia only controls a short North Sea coastline, it is only realistic to assume that any naval conflict against a hostile power will involve the North Sea. Whether it is to cut off the Russian Baltic Sea supplies or to attack British or French shipping lanes in the English Channel or the Atlantic, the North Sea is central to any naval tactical outlook. We need to maintain and expand our naval bases there."
 GER_expand_the_panzerwaffe:0 "Expand the Panzerwaffe"
 GER_expand_the_panzerwaffe_desc:0 "Paul Hausser and Heinz Guderian, both recently promoted to the generalship, have been obsessed and concerned with our armored force. Both of them have issued a joint paper about the offensive capabilities of armored forces and that the defensive approach of the Prussian leadership's deployment of armored units is insufficient. It is safe to say the armored force deserves attention."
 GER_schutzplan_ost:0 "Schutzplan Ost"
 GER_schutzplan_ost_desc:0 "Russia remains the enemy. While reactionary dreamers seem to think the Tsar an ally against 'western liberalism', it remains undeniable that Russia is expansionistic for the sake of expansionism. Such an internally weak state, so prone to collapse, cannot be relied upon to be Prussia's ally or Prussia's friend. We shall expand the Lohmeyer plans to develop Schutzplan Ost, the defensive plan in the east."
 GER_expand_baltic_ports:0 "Expand Baltic Ports"
 GER_expand_baltic_ports_desc:0 "While the North Sea is always the central theater of naval operations in offensive scenarios, the admiralty points to numerous defensive preparations it has made for the eventuality of a totally inferior Prussian navy (which is frankliy realistic). In such planning, Prussia remains only active in the Baltic Sea. We need to expand our Baltic ports because of this possibility."
 GER_heeresreform:0 "Heeresreform"
 GER_heeresreform_desc:0 "After the recent re-orientation of the panzer forces as an offensive rather than a defensive tool, reforming the entire army for the offensive is the next logical step. Guderian continues to speak of his theories of 'Mobile Warfare', whereas Manstein proposes a transition to French-style 'Superior Firepower' tactics. Either way, our army will become a new and improved weapon never before seen."
 GER_bundeswehr:0 "Reichswehr"
 GER_bundeswehr_desc:0 "The Prussian constitution has given a primacy to the Army that results in the Army not being allowed to be subject to a supreme command. The only conceivable way to circumvent this constitutional nightmare is to simply disband the army, reform the constitution and to then create a new and improved body for the entire armed forces, the Reichswehr."
 GER_naval_armament_plan:0 "Naval Armament Plan"
 GER_naval_armament_plan_desc:0 "Naval industrial facilities are without alternative for an aspiring naval power. Building dockyards in Hamburg, Lübeck, Danzig and Königsberg is essential to our future naval ambition."
 GER_schutzplan_sued:0 "Schutzplan Süd"
 GER_schutzplan_sued_desc:0 "Austria is the cancer of every European map. They hold Silesia, rightfully Prussian, and they have subjugated many foreign peoples that could potentially be Prussia's allies or, even better, Prussia's subjects. We need to prepare for the eventuality of Austrian military invasion by enacting Schutzplan Süd, the defensive plan in the south."
 GER_expand_the_luftwaffe:0 "Expand the Luftwaffe"
 GER_expand_the_luftwaffe_desc:0 "With the [Root.GetBundeswehrName] created, we have finally overcome constitutional barriers to focus exclusively on the Luftwaffe rather than just handing funds to the army and hoping they'd be spent as intended. It is very important to maintain a strong air force, as especially France is known for its formidable air power."
 GER_political_focus:0 "Political Focus"
 GER_political_focus_desc:0 "Prussia's political situation remains delicate: King Wilhelm II is highly unpopular, the völkisch movement is gaining steam and Rosa Luxemburg's radical leftists keep organizing strikes against the moderate social democratic government. Prussia needs to tread carefully internally and externally in order to stay on top."
 GER_expand_the_foreign_ministry:0 "Expand the Foreign Ministry"
 GER_expand_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 "Foreign Minister Kuno von Westarp has repeatedly requested additional funds for his overstretched ministry. In order to project Prussian influence in the world, building a powerful foreign office can be considered to be invaluable."
 GER_expand_the_interior_ministry:0 "Expand the Interior Ministry"
 GER_expand_the_interior_ministry_desc:0 "If Westarp's foreign ministry is underfunded, Kurt Schumacher's ministry for the interior is living through a financial apocalypse. The taxation system, welfare state and security bureaus are all complaining about lack of funding, lack of legislation and lack of public attention. We need to do something about this, and fast."
 GER_friendship_with_saxony:0 "Friendship with Saxony"
 GER_friendship_with_saxony_desc:0 "Saxony has been the target of both Prussian and Austrian imperalistic ambition in the past, and Saxon politicians always tried to maintain the balance - until recently. Saxony joined the Danube Pact in 1901 and has stayed close to Austria since. We cannot afford to accept this additional thorn in our side and we should remind the Saxons that they could switch allegiance at any time."
 GER_friendship_with_thuringia:0 "Friendship with Thuringia"
 GER_friendship_with_thuringia_desc:0 "While Thuringia itself is small, it is in a central and strategically vital position in the heart of Germany. Prussia has traditionally been Thuringia's protector against Austrian encroachment, and we will further our mutually beneficial relationship with the Erfurt government to assure peace and prosperity in both Thuringia and Prussia."
 GER_financial_reform:0 "Financial Reform"
 GER_financial_reform_desc:0 "Our banking system is outdated, our welfare state notably corrupt and the taxation bureau inefficient. The Prussian financial system is in dire need for effective reform."
 GER_friendship_with_russia:0 "Friendship with Russia"
 GER_friendship_with_russia_desc:0 "Although Russia once was Prussia's enemy in the Great War, the successful joint anti-Polish actions showed just how potent a partnership between Berlin and St Petersburg (although the Russian capital is now Moscow) could be. The Russians are our best bet for a reliable and useful strategic ally on this chaotic and messy continent."
 GER_prussian_ambition:0 "Prussian Ambition"
 GER_prussian_ambition_desc:0 "With our eastern diplomatic course settled for now, we need to turn west, where two great powers are in constant diplomatic conflict. Prussia has traditionally been the ally of the British, but are they really that useful after all?"
 GER_friendship_with_sweden:0 "Friendship with Sweden"
 GER_friendship_with_sweden_desc:0 "Although enemies in the Great War, Prussia and Sweden have since silently developed a bond due to their shared Germanic heritage and close economic and geographic proximity. Sweden is an ally we need to pursue."
 GER_end_the_erbfeindschaft:0 "End the Erbfeindschaft"
 GER_end_the_erbfeindschaft_desc:0 "Prussian children are taught in school about how vicious and ill-meaning the Frenchman truly is. It will be quite the turn to suddenly change course from this practice and to instead teach our school kids that France and Prussia are natural allies, but if there is someone that will be even less pleased about this than Prussian children, it will be Great Britain. They will see this step as nothing short of betrayal."
 GER_honor_the_old_alliance:0 "Honor the Old Alliance"
 GER_honor_the_old_alliance_desc:0 "Remember, kids:\nFor all they have\nPrussia's got\nour British friends\nwhom they have not."
 GER_support_poland:0 "Support Poland"
 GER_support_poland_desc:0 "Sure, the Germans don't have much love for the Polish people in their hearts, and the Poles very much return that feeling, but both sides must admit that each other is better than the Russians. We should help the Polish gaining independence."
 GER_join_the_entente:0 "Join the Entente"
 GER_join_the_entente_desc:0 "The Entente is perhaps the most powerful military alliance on earth. And only the most powerful alliances are a good fit for the most powerful countries. Prussia and France should become true and committed allies."
 GER_join_the_commonwealth:0 "Join the Commonwealth"
 GER_join_the_commonwealth_desc:0 "A Prussian ascendance into the British Commonwealth was discussed in Prussian politics and in British-Prussian relations more than once. Prussia so far shied away from committing to Britain's military adventures due to France's crushing superiority, but we must now recognize that the only way to ever possibly get rid of the French is to form a powerful pact against them."
 GER_invite_hannover:0 "Invite Hannover"
 GER_invite_hannover_desc:0 "Hannover is a much-needed addition to our alliance. We should invite them as soon as possible."
 GER_invite_thuringia:0 "Invite Thuringia"
 GER_invite_thuringia_desc:0 "Thuringia has been a loyal friend for decades, and our recent entry into our military alliance leaves them out in the cold. Thuringia will not be forgotten!"
 GER_invite_saxony:0 "Invite Saxony"
 GER_invite_saxony_desc:0 "Saxony can at last be freed from Austrian influence. They need to join our alliance."
 GER_democratic_crusade:0 "Democratic Crusade"
 GER_democratic_crusade_desc:0 "It is at last time to embrace a form of democratic liberalized nationalism. So many of our fellow German brothers are oppressed by authoritarian rule and need to be freed."
 GER_allied_scientists:0 "Allied Scientists"
 GER_allied_scientists_desc:0 "Our new democratic allies will not only help us in our democratic ambitions regarding a Greater Germany, they will also strengthen our homefront by enabling additional researchers to serve the fatherland."
 GER_liberate_the_silesians:0 "Liberate the Silesians"
 GER_liberate_the_silesians_desc:0 "An attack on the Austrians has been planned and scheduled at least 67 times since the 1770s, but all attacks were cancelled beforehand. The only other thing that all of them had in common was the goal: The liberation of Silesia. Now that our 'democratic crusade' has given us the pretext for invasion, perhaps it is time to see if 68th time's the charm."
 GER_liberate_the_baltic_germans:0 "Liberate the Baltic Germans"
 GER_liberate_the_baltic_germans_desc:0 "The German community in the Russian Empire has been a long-oppressed minority, especially the populations in Estonia, Latvia, Livonia and Lithuania. It is time to at last challenge the behemoth: If we only kick in the front door, the entire rotten structure will come crashing down."
 GER_social_reform:0 "Social Reform"
 GER_social_reform_desc:0 "Otto von Bismarck, who has been dubbed the 'peacekeeper' because of his prosperous and peaceful chancellorship, introduced the pension system during his tenure as head of government of Prussia. Since then, each government tried to emulate the social welfare success of the Bismarck government in order to maintain stability."
 GER_force_wilhelms_abdication:0 "Force Wilhelm's Abdication"
 GER_force_wilhelms_abdication_desc:0 "King Wilhelm II is historically unpopular due to his silly public statements, his apparant inferiority complexes and his disinterest in public policy or the common citizen of Prussia. By contrast, his son, Crown Prince Wilhelm who is to be Wilhelm III, is seen as a reform-minded and progressive monarch and has favor with many who find his father distasteful. Wilhelm II needs to abdicate."
 GER_military_industrial_expansion:0 "Military-Industrial Expansion"
 GER_military_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "The army's economic attaché to the government, Hjalmar Schacht, has proposed a plan of creating thousands of jobs in the armament sector with a military industrialization program."
 GER_civilian_industrial_expansion:0 "Civilian Industrial Expansion"
 GER_civilian_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "The minister of finance, Otto Braun, has opposed plans by military attaché Schacht to endorse a full-on militarization program, pointing instead to the possibility of civilian expansion of the economy."
 GER_open_the_polish_prussian_border:0 "Open the Polish-Prussian Border"
 GER_open_the_polish_prussian_border_desc:0 "Prussia had a strict policy of keeping the borderlands between German Poland and Russian Poland clean in order to prevent Polish nationalism from spreading from Warsaw to Poznan. However, the recently discovered partnership with the Russians enables a joint anti-Polish policy and thus, both nations are now in the position to more efficiently exploit the Polish workforce."
 GER_strengthen_the_monarchy:0 "Strengthen the Monarchy"
 GER_strengthen_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Prussia's strict model of constitutional monarchy has obviously been a failure in guiding the country back to great power status. Perhaps, another shot at authoritarianism is in order, now that Prussia has a new king?"
 GER_defend_prussian_democracy:0 "Defend Prussian Democracy"
 GER_defend_prussian_democracy_desc:0 "It is obvious that Prussia is on the best way back to greatness imaginable. It is now important to crack down on any elements of the government implying that a turn away from democratic idealism is preferable."
 GER_expand_the_university_of_berlin:0 "Expand the University of Berlin"
 GER_expand_the_university_of_berlin_desc:0 "Berlin has become one of the most important cities in the world, effectively being the primate city for the entirety of Germany when it comes to science. From Emden to Passau, German students flock to Prussia for their studies - something that we can use to our advantage. We shall use these young minds to further expand the University in Berlin and to further gain a technogical edge."
 GER_friendship_with_poland:0 "Friendship with Poland"
 GER_friendship_with_poland_desc:0 "With the borders open and Russia and Prussia growing closer, it is perhaps the time to reconciliate with the Polish people. Can there be German-Polish friendship after all?"
 GER_koenigliche_armee:0 "Königliche Armee"
 GER_koenigliche_armee_desc:0 "It is clear that the army is not motivated enough when just fighting for foreign and unclear concepts like 'the people', 'the constitution' or 'liberty'. The army policy needs to be changed so that soldiers no longer swear an oath to Prussia or the Prussian people, but directly to the King."
 GER_anti_fascist_policy:0 "Anti-Fascist Policy"
 GER_anti_fascist_policy_desc:0 "Fascism, hyper-nationalism and Rosenbergian thought are a danger not only to Prussia and not only to liberty and freedom, but to humanity itself. Crushing fascism and other far-right ideologies has to be Prussia's main goal in foreign policy."
 GER_anti_communist_policy:0 "Anti-Communist Policy"
 GER_anti_communist_policy_desc:0 "Marxism and the rest of communist scumminess is the most threatening of Prussia's enemies. Destroying communism has to be the first priority."
 GER_social_democratic_dominance:0 "Social Democratic Dominance"
 GER_social_democratic_dominance_desc:0 "The Otto Wels administration and the SPP appear to know the way after all. Their government, now stabilized, should continue leading the country."
 GER_conservative_dominance:0 "Conservative Dominance"
 GER_conservative_dominance_desc:0 "The social democrats are too close to communism for comfort, and the people long desire a government party less at odds with Prussian values of militarism and social protestantism. Manfred von Richthofen, often called the 'father of the air force', has assembled an impressive political party during his retirement, the PCKP, the Prussian Christian Conservative Party. Perhaps Otto Wels should step aside."
 GER_friendship_with_serbia:0 "Friendship with Serbia"
 GER_friendship_with_serbia_desc:0 "Serbia, Russia's one true friend in Europe, is a strong and proud nation that deserves our friendship and comradery."
 GER_strengthen_the_officer_corps:0 "Strengthen the Officer Corps"
 GER_strengthen_the_officer_corps_desc:0 "Prussian officers are among the most established parts of Berlin's society. Reinforcing the old men in their old position is what is needed to hold our society line."
 GER_appease_communist_strongholds:0 "Appease Communist Strongholds"
 GER_appease_communist_strongholds_desc:0 "Now that fascism has been declared our primary target, we should be able to forge a permanent alliance with parts of the population that are more in support of communism than democracy."
 GER_appease_fascist_strongholds:0 "Appease Fascist Strongholds"
 GER_appease_fascist_strongholds_desc:0 "Although they will not be happy with the democratic system, the fascistic parts of the population will now be more willing to support the government after we declared the far-left forces of the world the primary threat to our country."
 GER_equality_for_askaris:0 "Equality for Askaris"
 GER_equality_for_askaris_desc:0 "The social democratic government is unhappy with Prussia's colonial policy. Our colonies, especially East Africa, are full of hard-working and loyal people who want nothing more than to become Prussian citizens and vote for representatives in the Prussian parliament. Should their skin color invalidate their efforts and hard work for Prussia? Never! We will make them loyal by granting them equality - the French model."
 GER_continued_colonial_exploitation:0 "Continued Colonial Exploitation"
 GER_continued_colonial_exploitation_desc:0 "The SPP's talk of granting equality to lesser races and ethnic groups subject to Prussia is absolutely insane. Instead, the Prussian colonial peoples should be put back to work - pay, housing and medical care should be enough for them. Granting them voting rights will only give them silly little thoughts of independence."
 GER_join_the_holy_alliance:0 "Join the Holy Alliance"
 GER_join_the_holy_alliance_desc:0 "Prussia and Russia. Christian Monarchies. Strong states. Determined peoples. Prussia and Russia are meant to be allies.\nPrussia must join the Holy Alliance."
 GER_pan_nationalistic_ambition:0 "Pan-Nationalistic Ambition"
 GER_pan_nationalistic_ambition_desc:0 "With our governments strengthened and our country secure, it is time to turn southwards. Germany must be united at last! The French have singlehandedly denied the Germans the right to unification, but this discrimination is now over. Forever."
 GER_secure_northern_germany:0 "Secure Northern Germany"
 GER_secure_northern_germany_desc:0 "Northern Germany is traditionally Prussia's rightful sphere of influence, as it outside of both Austria's and France's direct reach. However, especially Hannover's communist adventure has left Prussia faced with the rumor that Berlin is unable to control the north of the German lands. Time to prove the rumors wrong."
 GER_secure_eastern_germany:0 "Secure Eastern Germany"
 GER_secure_eastern_germany_desc:0 "Eastern Germany is a diplomatic battleground between Austria and Prussia: Saxony is aligned with the Danube Pact, whereas Thuringia embarks on a journey of Prussia-aligned neutrality, whatever that means. Securing the eastern region of Germany is vital in order to contain Austrian dreams of territorial dominance."
 GER_secure_southern_germany:0 "Secure Southern Germany"
 GER_secure_southern_germany_desc:0 "Southern Germany has always been able to remove itself from Prussia's influence the most. The southeners, trapped between France and Austria, never even considered Prussia a serious threat to their independence either way. That is about to change."
 GER_secure_western_germany:0 "Secure Western Germany"
 GER_secure_western_germany_desc:0 "The west of Germany is France's domain, no question. Well, no question until now. Westphalia and Hesse especially have aligned with French-style democratic liberalism hoping it would preserve their sovereignity. Sadly, their assumptions are miscalculations."
 GER_kaisertum_preussen:0 "Kaisertum Preußen"
 GER_kaisertum_preussen_desc:0 "It is time to at last raise the feudal rank of the King of Prussia to match that of the Austrian Emperor. Kaiser! Kaiser! Kaiser! Kaiser of Prussia!"
 GER_form_the_german_confederation:0 "Form the German Confederation"
 GER_form_the_german_confederation_desc:0 "Instead of joining French, British or Russian interest groups made to serve their respective leading countries, Prussia should form its own faction to serve only Prussia's goals. The German Confederation, formed with the German minors, will rise from the ashes!"
 GER_invite_the_german_democracies:0 "Invite the German Democracies"
 GER_invite_the_german_democracies_desc:0 "There is no need for territorial expansion - yet. We will for now assemble allies and keep a low profile, starting with a call to all German democracies to join the Confederation."
 GER_ultimatum_to_the_fascists:0 "Ultimatum to the Fascists"
 GER_ultimatum_to_the_fascists_desc:0 "Rosenbergian fascism first came to Germany with Württemberg's fall to far-right ideologies in May of 1927. It is time to break the back of this fascistic beast before the völkisch movement can spread any farther."
 GER_ultimatum_to_the_communists:0 "Ultimatum to the Communists"
 GER_ultimatum_to_the_communists_desc:0 "The Hannoverian fall to communism of 1921 has shown quite efficiently the many dangers and pitfalls of communism. We remember well when Hannover's moderate social democrats were put on show trials by the Abel administration. German communism must be destroyed - now and forever."
 GER_ultimatum_to_the_authoritarians:0 "Ultimatum to the Authoritarians"
 GER_ultimatum_to_the_authoritarians_desc:0 "The old order has subdued freedom and liberty in Germany for far too long. We will break the reactionary elites that are controlled by their Austrian and Russian puppet masters - by diplomacy or by force."
 GER_reconstruction_of_germany:0 "Reconstruction of Germany"
 GER_reconstruction_of_germany_desc:0 "The fatherland has been decisively weakened and damaged by the war. We should take time to clean up, pick up the rubble and restore jobs to the population."
 GER_call_the_constitutional_assembly:0 "Call the Constitutional Assembly"
 GER_call_the_constitutional_assembly_desc:0 "Now that democracy rules Germany, it is time to call the first free general elections to draft an all-German constitution."
 GER_militarization_of_germany:0 "Militarization of Germany"
 GER_militarization_of_germany_desc:0 "WIP"
 GER_the_unification_of_germany:0 "The Unification of Germany"
 GER_the_unification_of_germany_desc:0 "Since the liberalization of Prussia and France, liberal pan-nationalism has been a popular movement in Germany. Now, Prussia is at last able to reach this highest of goals, the highest of ideals: The unification of the fatherland.\nDeutschland, Deutschland über alles!"
 GER_secure_alsace_lorraine:0 "Secure Alsace-Lorraine"
 GER_secure_alsace_lorraine_desc:0 "The birth of the German nation marks the appearance of a new potential superpower on the world stage - but the only way to become the superpower is to dethrone the ruling one. It is time to humiliate France, once and for all."
 GER_Freedom_League:0 "The Freedom League"
