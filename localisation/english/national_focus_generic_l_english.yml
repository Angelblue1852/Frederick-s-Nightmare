 generic_political_effort:0 "Political Effort"
 generic_political_effort_desc:0 "The world stands at a crossroads: Far-left parties are gaining power - usually using somewhat democratic means of political self-determination - which often results in reactionary responses from the center and right of the political spectrum. Fascistic takeovers have also taken place in countries like Naples and Württemberg. We must determine where we truly stand on these issues."
 generic_communist_tendencies:0 "Communist Tendencies"
 generic_communist_tendencies_desc:0 "Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were German philosophers and businessmen who designed the political concepts of 'radical egalitarianism', also called marxism or communism. When in London and later Hannover, the two formulated the demand to have the means of production returned to the proletariat in order to eventually make the class of capitalists arbitrary."
 generic_democratic_ideals:0 "Democratic Ideals"
 generic_democratic_ideals_desc:0 "Trusting the government to shape itself is foolish. Democracy is a concept going back to at least ancient Greece and has more recently been mostly associated with Aragoism, named after François Arago, French Prime Minister and mastermind of the French reformist movements of the 1850s and 1860s that saw France turn from an absolutist empire to a modern pluralistic state."
 generic_authoritarian_ambitions:0 "Authoritarian Ambitions"
 generic_authoritarian_ambitions_desc:0 "While fascists and communists do have a point that the masses cannot be trusted to govern themselves like the Democrats foolishly believe, going to the political extremism of either of these ideologies is simply unhinged and wrong. We need to trust a selected tradionalistic elite rather than a young upstart political movement. Giving power to the order of old is the way to go."
 generic_fascistic_reforms:0 "Fascistic Reforms"
 generic_fascistic_reforms_desc:0 "Democracy is weak, communism is cancer, the authoritarians are stupid and give their citizens too many rights, the Jews are awful people conspiring against the world and the capitalists will either cooperate with the government's cronies or be sent to a prison camp for re-education. Hyper-nationalism is the only way forward for the nation state."
 generic_strengthen_the_unions:0 "Strengthen the Unions"
 generic_strengthen_the_unions_desc:0 "Allowing the workers to unionize was one of the most important political developments of the 19th and early 20th centuries. By continuing to backing the worker unions politically, we will give both a feeling of security and actual security to the workers, leading to higher levels of employment and higher levels of satisfaction within the working class."
 generic_secure_civil_rights:0 "Secure Civil Rights"
 generic_secure_civil_rights_desc:0 "The extremist ideas of sacrificing individual rights for the sake of the collective is foolish. While a certain amount of government is necessary to prevent total anarchy, people at their core should be given the utmost degree of freedom that can be afforded. Civil rights need to be reinforced."
 generic_national_militarism:0 "National Militarism"
 generic_national_militarism_desc:0 "The military is the main organ of the state and the expansion and upkeep of the armed forces is the most important function of government. By establishing a nationalistic cult of militarism through the founding of patriotic marching bands, patriotic culture programs and military youth organizations, the government should be able to convince more young people to enlist in the army."
 generic_political_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"
 generic_political_commissars_desc:0 "Enforcing the communist ideology requires a strict and total repression of individual liberties through the usage of political commissars in order to prevent the bourgeoisie from deceiving the proletariat and convincing them of systems like 'democracy', which are basically oligarchism-in-disguise. Thankfully, the communist party knows what's best for the entire country and all people."
 generic_popular_defense:0 "Popular Defense"
 generic_popular_defense_desc:0 "Our peace and liberty come at a price.\n\nSome say freedom is free,\nbut we tend to disagree.\nWe say freedom is won\nthrough the barrel of a gun."
 generic_strengthen_the_officer_corps:0 "Strengthen the Officer Corps"
 generic_strengthen_the_officer_corps_desc:0 "Securing our borders and the enforcement of our laws and thus our civil stability is mostly the job of the police forces, but the army needs to be able and ready to step in at any moment should things not go as planned. We need to make sure the country has an educated and efficient officer class with many new recruits chosen by both merit and ideological compatibility."
 generic_assault_divisions:0 "Assault Divisions"
 generic_assault_divisions_desc:0 "Arthur Rosenberg once wrote 'the fascist movement is carried only on the shoulders of the soldiers that are willing to fight and die for the ideology, thus every man needs to become a loyal soldier of the fascist state."\nWe need to form paramilitary assault divisions."
 generic_militarize_the_workforce:0 "Militarize the Workforce"
 generic_militarize_the_workforce_desc:0 "Defending the revolution requires a sufficient military production base. Those in our country that still remain unemployment will be drafted into a new labor force that is to occupy new and improved military production facilities. Every man and woman of our country needs to serve the constitution."
 generic_international_research_compact:0 "International Research Compact"
 generic_international_research_compact_desc:0 "The democratic nations of the world began assembling in international university networks and multinational research projects, something that the other ideologies could never dream of doing due to their jealousy of each other, even within their ideological 'family of brethren'. We need to join as many international democratic research projects as possible."
 generic_reinforce_traditional_values:0 "Reinforce Traditional Values"
 generic_reinforce_traditional_values_desc:0 "Remind the people of who protects them, who feeds them, who keeps them safe from foreign invasion. The old elites have been benevolent rulers and will be once more - we just need to make the people believe in that. Those who refuse authority are destined to doom our nation to failure."
 generic_rosenbergian_ideology:0 "Rosenbergian Ideology"
 generic_rosenbergian_ideology_desc:0 "Alfred Rosenberg of Württemberg developed a new theory of 'international nationalism', where there would be nationalistic governments in all nations to make compromise between nationalists possible. Most fascistic movements in the world have to at least some extent endorsed this Rosenbergian worldview of global fascism."
 generic_popular_revolution:0 "Popular Revolution"
 generic_popular_revolution_desc:0 "We have prepared a communist takeover. Time to tell the red militias to march forth and take the cities and towns, to plant red banners on all town halls, castles, barracks and factories. Our nation will join the workers of the world! Workers of the world, unite!"
 generic_government_reform:0 "Government Reform"
 generic_government_reform_desc:0 "Democratic ambition has grown strong and has been persistent within our country. The moment to seize power to a democratic interim government and to prepare free elections has come."
 generic_strengthen_the_reactionary_elites:0 "Strengthen the Reactionary Elites"
 generic_strengthen_the_reactionary_elites_desc:0 "Foolish youngsters have controlled the government long enough. The return of political influence to the forces of old is long overdue."
 generic_fascist_coup:0 "Fascist Coup"
 generic_fascist_coup_desc:0 "Our country is run by weaklings and uses a weakling system. It is time to crush the old establishment, to march into our cities, march on the capital and seize control in the name of the nation. The Jewish conspiracy must be stopped!"
 generic_leftist_alignment:0 "Leftist Alignment"
 generic_leftist_alignment_desc:0 "Communists and Democrats are natural allies against the old reactionary order of monarchies and the new threat posed by fascism. We need to set aside our ideological differences."
 generic_centrist_alignment:0 "Centrist Alignment"
 generic_centrist_alignment_desc:0 "Both the young reformers and the old elites need to recognize that their respective radical extremists are doing nothing less than driving humanity into the abyss. Democrats and Authoritarians need to ally."
 generic_right_wing_alignment:0 "Right Wing Alignment"
 generic_right_wing_alignment_desc:0 "Defending against the leftist degeneracy and reactionary fervor sometimes takes realpolitik. The old elites need to acknowledge that the young blackshirts are a true force to be reckoned with, whereas the blackshirts need to build trust in at least some systems of old in order to destroy communists and liberals."
 generic_construction_program:0 "Construction Program"
 generic_construction_program_desc:0 "Cities can be built using three things: Sweat, blood and steel. Get more workers to sweat and bleed, get more steel to be used. It is as simple."
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_1:0 "Infrastructure Expansion I"
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_1_desc:0 "In order to prepare the massive expansion of our infrastructure we are planning, we first need to see to a railway buildup. We should prepare several new train stations in our cities to connect them with each other."
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_2:0 "Infrastructure Expansion II"
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_2_desc:0 "The railways have served us well, but trains cannot go everywhere. Building more motorways will enable our more rural populations to also enjoy connection with the rest of our realm."
 generic_industrial_effort_1:0 "Industrial Effort I"
 generic_industrial_effort_1_desc:0 "Stabilizing an economy comes down to the fundamentals of creating employment opportunity for the civilian population."
 generic_financial_reform:0 "Financial Reform"
 generic_financial_reform_desc:0 "Our currency is not quite as strong as it could be. We should implement reforms in monetary and financial legislation in order to strengthen our central bank and expand our control our national banking system."
 generic_industrial_effort_2:0 "Industrial Effort II"
 generic_industrial_effort_2_desc:0 "Heavy Industry of the civilian kind is the key to keeping national projects running. Creating heavy industry jobs in our urban areas will in the long term enable us to further both our civilian and our military economc apparatuses."
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_3:0 "Infrastructure Expansion III"
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_3_desc:0 "Investing in new models for trains for our railway system has been proposed in order to make the train network faster and more fuel-efficient. Local civilian airports are to help with desolate and remote places in our realm."
 generic_military_industrial_effort_1:0 "Military-Industrial Effort I"
 generic_military_industrial_effort_1_desc:0 "In order to boost the war machine, we need to build new heavy industrial facilities designed specifically for the purpose of constructing artillery and tanks."
 generic_industrial_effort_3:0 "Industrial Effort III"
 generic_industrial_effort_3_desc:0 "While our primate city and our other primary cities have been served, our secondary cities are also craving for industrial opportunities for their populations. We need to further expand the economic offers to the citizens."
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_4:0 "Infrastructure Expansion IV"
 generic_infrastructure_expansion_4_desc:0 "Expand the railways! Expand the motorways! Expand the airports! More infrastructure! More infrastructure!"
 generic_military_industrial_effort_2:0 "Military-Industrial Effort II"
 generic_military_industrial_effort_2_desc:0 "Building an airforce requires specific heavy industrial plants. We should serve our aircraft companies with the respective facilities."
 generic_military_industrial_effort_3:0 "Military-Industrial Effort III"
 generic_military_industrial_effort_3_desc:0 "We are building rifles, tanks, aircraft, artillery. All of it is expensive and takes a long time to finish. While cutting down the production times will be difficult."
 generic_expand_the_secret_service:0 "Expand the Secret Service"
 generic_expand_the_secret_service_desc:0 "Securing the position of our country in the world requires a strong secret service network. We should mobilize new government funding for the intelligence agencies."
 generic_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"
 generic_education_reform_desc:0 "Our schooling system leaves a lot to be desired. We need to introduce new legislation regulating the work of school principals and teachers. Further, a total crackdown on child labor will assure that all children visit school."
 generic_invest_in_the_university_system:0 "Invest in the University System"
 generic_invest_in_the_university_system_desc:0 "Famous Prussian scientist Albert Einstein once noted that 'the way to world peace leads through science towards universal education.'\nHis optimism may be naive, but his logic gives food for thought: Perhaps we can not only achieve world peace, but also world domination, through science? We need our young people to be smarter than our old people were back in the day."
 generic_government_expansion:0 "Government Expansion"
 generic_government_expansion_desc:0 "The government needs more legislators, more bureaucrats, more overseers and more desk clerks. Recruiting massive amounts of new personnel to the civilian administration will eventually benefit the military leadership, as it will help us with making our theoretical proceedings more efficient and straightforward, paradoxical as that might be."
 generic_synthetic_oil_projects:0 "Synthetic Oil Projects"
 generic_synthetic_oil_projects_desc:0 "Oil, a resource that we cannot do without do to the combustion engine's dependence upon it, is constrained to parts of the world that we not always have access to. Creating oil-like substances at home to substitute natural petroleum might be the way to go in order to secure our military's access to fuel."
 generic_ballistics_research:0 "Ballistics Research"
 generic_ballistics_research_desc:0 "Developing ballistic missiles will be a vital step in achieving a new and improved way of deploying devastating weapons against our enemy. Furthermore, the achievement of modern ballistics will be the next step on the long way to manned spaceflight."
 generic_synthetic_rubber_projects:0 "Synthetic Rubber Projects"
 generic_synthetic_rubber_projects_desc:0 "Rubber is an invaluable resource for the production of civilian and military resources, but it is limited to very specific parts of the world, most of which are tropical. Countries that don't have direct access to this part of the world or that don't have colonies there must develop new tactics to assure the flow and supply of rubber even when cut off from these territories - say, during wartime."
 generic_atomic_research:0 "Atomic Research"
 generic_atomic_research_desc:0 "The science of splitting the atom is so far theoretical, but the world's physicists predict that nuclear fission could unleash higher amounts of energy than a million bullets could. American scientist Oppenheimer described the potential effects as 'city-flattening' back in 1934."
 generic_oil_refineries:0 "Oil Refineries"
 generic_oil_refineries_desc:0 "After overseeing the scientific progress necessary to assure access to artificial oil, we should now see to it that we capitalize on our advances by constructing several Oil Refineries in our territories."
 generic_extra_research_slot:0 "Extra Research Slot"
 generic_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "Employing additional research units is now possible thanks to our advances in our university and education system. Our military and our civilian economy will profit immensely thanks to our innovations."
 generic_extra_research_slot_2:0 "Extra Research Slot 2"
 generic_extra_research_slot_2_desc:0 "Education has taken us this far. From here on out, experimentation has to take precedence over the theory of classrooms. We should use our massive industrial base to continuously develop new prototype for civilian and military research."
 generic_expand_the_air_force:0 "Expand the Air Force"
 generic_expand_the_air_force_desc:0 "Air travel has yet to celebrate its 30th birthday, but it is already clear that gliding through the air is the future of mankind - especially when it comes to gliding through the air to deploy deadly weapons over enemy cities. Our air force cannot afford to lose this arms race."
 generic_establish_the_air_force_research_division:0 "Establish the Air Force Research Division"
 generic_establish_the_air_force_research_division_desc:0 "Our air force is still young and has lots of potential. We could specialize fighter planes into light and heavy models, we could differentiate bombers into tactical and strategic kinds, we could combine the two to create 'Close Air Support' units. The possibilities are endless!"
 generic_fighter_production:0 "Fighter Production"
 generic_fighter_production_desc:0 "The fighter is the base unit of air warfare and is necessary to prevent the enemy from bombing our armies and urban areas. We need to develop new and innovative fighter models to hopefully gain an advantage."
 generic_air_force_doctrine:0 "Air Force Doctrine"
 generic_air_force_doctrine_desc:0 "Air force can take different faces: Should we use fighters as our primary aerial police? Should our industrial effort go towards tactical bombing campaigns to support frontline units? Should we follow the Harrisonian thought of a destructive anti-civilian campaign of strategic bombing runs? A long debate is ahead of us."
 generic_bomber_production:0 "Bomber Production"
 generic_bomber_production_desc:0 "Destroying the enemy cities and the hostile industrial base from afar will be far more effective in cutting off enemy supplies than trying to bleed the enemy dry by draining their manpower in direct combat. An enemy soldier without a rifle is just as good as a dead enemy soldier. We need to innovate aerial warfare with new and improved bomber planes."
 generic_air_bases_1:0 "Air Bases I"
 generic_air_bases_1_desc:0 "Militarizing airports is the way forward. Expanding our civilian airports to military air bases will enable us to deploy the airforce more quickly and more efficiently."
 generic_naval_bomber_production:0 "Naval Bomber Production"
 generic_naval_bomber_production_desc:0 "Attacking a superior navy with our own warships might be suicide, but thanks to aerial combat, we have achieved a new and better way of annihilating our enemy: By deploying naval bombers either from aircraft carriers or coastal airfields, we could strike our enemy with painful accuracy, sinking battleships, heavy cruisers and other major warships without giving them a chance to retaliate."
 generic_air_bases_2:0 "Air Bases II"
 generic_air_bases_2_desc:0 "While militarization of civilian airports has taken us forward to some extent, we won't be able to completely avoid building entirely new military airfields. We should survey and allocate the spots for new potential air bases."
 generic_expand_the_navy:0 "Expand the Navy"
 generic_expand_the_navy_desc:0 "Dominating the high seas is a luxury only the greatest of powers can afford - and we are certainly among this elevated elite rank of nations. We should see to it that our naval forces scare the world with their overwhelming might."
 generic_naval_dockyards_1:0 "Naval Dockyards I"
 generic_naval_dockyards_1_desc:0 "A strong navy requires industrial power as its backbone - but you cannot use an everyday factory to produce warships. We will not be able to avoid building specialized naval dockyards in our ports and harbors - if we don't do it, our enemies will. And if our enemies will, our sailors and coastal populations will suffer because of it."
 generic_naval_bases:0 "Naval Bases"
 generic_naval_bases_desc:0 "A navy's base is like a turtle's shell - the navy can't go far and is completely naked and prone to attack without its base. Just producing naval dockyards will not be sufficient to assure our dominance on the oceans - we also need to build naval bases."
 generic_naval_doctrine_1:0 "Naval Doctrine I"
 generic_naval_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The old idea of assembling a fleet as big as possible and building an armada to just smash the enemy is outdated. Fleet in Being? Trade Interdiction? Base Strike? We will have to decide soon."
 generic_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
 generic_carrier_focus_desc:0 "Building aircraft carriers has so far been reserved to great powers like Japan, France and the British Republic. These countries appear to be doing something right and our admirals insist that we should try to emulate what they have been doing - forming carrier groups around aircraft carriers will allow us to deploy mobile and deadly aircraft to support our fleets."
 generic_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship Focus"
 generic_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Battleships were once called 'the old queens' by Austrian admiral Hermann Boehm. The concept of dreadnoughts might appear outdated and any navy using battleships certainly has to consider the downsides of these bulky, slow-moving sitting ducks. Either way, the battleship's impressive firepower and cost-efficiency cannot be in doubt."
 generic_expand_the_submarine_force:0 "Expand the Submarine Force"
 generic_expand_the_submarine_force_desc:0 "Submarines have long been viewed as a dishonorable weapon in naval warfare, but especially smaller naval powers like Prussia have long advocated that their respective naval forces should embrace these silent hunters in order to attack the great naval powers and their overwhelming force through ambush and deceit. Dönitz called submarines 'the future of any numerically inferior naval force' in 1934."
 generic_destroyer_projects:0 "Destroyer Projects"
 generic_destroyer_projects_desc:0 "While the 'base ship' of most navies has traditionally been the cruiser, the cruiser's weakness against submarines has increasingly led to admirals shifting their interest towards destroyers as the backbone of any fleet. 'If a single submarine can sink an entire fleet, we should add a member to said fleet to sink that submarine first', as a report of the French admirality put it in 1932."
 generic_naval_dockyards_2:0 "Naval Dockyards II"
 generic_naval_dockyards_2_desc:0 "We require further industrialization of our coastal regions specifically for the purpose of building a massive and resilient combat fleet. Additional naval yards are necessary to keep up with our enemy on the high seas."
 generic_naval_doctrine_2:0 "Naval Doctrine II"
 generic_naval_doctrine_2_desc:0 "We might have decided between Base Strike, Trade Interdiction and the Fleet in Being, but now we need to show commitment to our choice. Just choosing a family of naval teachings will not magically give our admirals guidelines - we need to deepen and refine our naval capabilities."
 generic_naval_dockyards_3:0 "Naval Doctrine III"
 generic_naval_dockyards_3_desc:0 "Our naval forces have gotten very close to being world class in terms of naval doctrine and modern innovation in ocean combat. We just require a little bit more doctrinal renewal."
 generic_expand_the_army:0 "Expand the Army"
 generic_expand_the_army_desc:0 "While air forces are exciting and a navy clearly is visually impressive, the bulk of any war will be carried on the shoulders of our army: Our infantrymen who hold rifles rather than operating a ship's turrets, our tank crews who operate vehicles that don't need to visit an airport every so often. Our armed forces consist of three branches, sure, but our army must be the most important one."
 generic_army_doctrine_1:0 "Army Doctrine I"
 generic_army_doctrine_1_desc:0 "Our army leadership has conflicting views on how the military should be run? Maximize the troop count with the 'Mass Assault' theory? Bring about an inherently defensive and careful style of fighting by using the 'Grand Battleplan'? Should we endorse highly mechanized forces and quickly tear through our enemy with 'Mobile Warfare'? Or should we focus on artillery and fire support with the help of the 'Superior Firepower' ideas?"
 generic_rifle_production:0 "Rifle Production"
 generic_rifle_production_desc:0 "The infantryman is the most basic unit of military fighting, and the rifle is the infantryman's most basic and most trusted resource. Giving the infantryman better rifles will certainly overhaul the military and improve it as a whole."
 generic_form_the_special_forces:0 "Form the Special Forces"
 generic_form_the_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountaineers, Paratroopers and Marines mark highly specialized infantry units that are able to fill elite roles in specific terrains. By preparing special forces for combat, we assure ourselves that amphibious invasions, paradrops and mountain combat are all in the range of possibilities for our troops."
 generic_artillery_production:0 "Artillery Production"
 generic_artillery_production_desc:0 "Producing tanks, close air support planes and rocket launchers is fine as an idea, but these infantry support weapons are untested and expensive. Falling back on man's best friend, the artillery howitzer, will prove decisive in the conflicts to come."
 generic_armored_production:0 "Armored Production"
 generic_armored_production_desc:0 "Generals like Guderian have long predicted that the future belongs to the tank. We can't afford to be left behind in time - nor can we afford having our troops overrun be enemy armored beasts."
 generic_the_airborne_corps:0 "The Airborne Corps"
 generic_the_airborne_corps_desc:0 "Jumping from mechanical steel birds onto battlefields filled with projectiles moving at the speed of the sound sounds like insanity. We need to find the insane people willing to do it and form an airborne corps with them."
 generic_army_doctrine_2:0 "Army Doctrine II"
 generic_army_doctrine_2_desc:0 "While initial developments of our land force doctrines were promising, they are far from sufficient to secure our troops' success on the battlefield. We need to continue and even strengthen our endeavors to further our army's efficiency in the field."
 generic_the_marine_corps:0 "The Marine Corps"
 generic_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "Establishing a special force that focuses on amphibious operations, emulating for example the U.S. Marine Corps, will enable us to carry out short- to medium-range invasion operations across bodies of water, landing on the enemy's beaches to bring the fight directly to them."
