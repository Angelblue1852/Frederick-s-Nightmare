 JAP_fengtian_deadline_desc:0 "Displeased by the slower and methodical approach taken by the general staff, a cabal of young officers have staged a false flag against the Mantetsu to justify an invasion against Fengtian. If the ploy is to succeed, the war against Zhang must be quick. For we risk the public's interest turning against us the longer the war drags on, and the government may become sufficiently emboldened to stop us."
