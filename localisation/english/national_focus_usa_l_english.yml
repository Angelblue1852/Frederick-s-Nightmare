 USA_align_with_france_desc:0 "The Republican Party's main goal in foreign policy is to preserve peace on the North American continent by creating a close relationship between the U.S. and the French-led Entente faction. This is a worthwhile endeavour and should be continued by enacting foreign policy legislation like the French Language Act, which is to make the French language mandatory as a second language in American schools."

 USA_join_the_entente_desc:0 "The United States held out in caution and isolation for a long time.

 USA_lessons_from_fraus_desc:0 "Fraus Varäna, often just called "Fraus", is shaking up the Swedish government's deep-going corruption issues. The American ambassador in Stockholm, Frederick Sterling, has been in contact with Varäna on behalf of the Wadsworth administration - perhaps we could learn something from the Swedes?"
 USA_friendship_with_quebec:0 "Friendship with Quebec"
 USA_friendship_with_quebec_desc:0 "The United States has long accepted that 'Canada' is no more. Since the anglo population was displaced in favor of francophone settlers, the mighty nation (and for a long time French overseas territory) of Quebec sits at America's northern border. Not getting into a fight with this potential partner would be mutually beneficial."
 USA_naval_focus:0 "Naval Focus"
 USA_naval_focus_desc:0 "With the continental peace secured after the U.S. entry into the Entente, we finally have time to develop and expand our navy. Naval innovators like Nimitz have great ideas, and with the land borders secure, we now actually have time to listen to them."
 USA_pass_the_liberty_protection_act:0 "Pass the Liberty Protection Act"
 USA_pass_the_liberty_protection_act_desc:0 "'The safety of U.S. citizens is protected by the continuous trade-off of liberties and securities. Sometimes, the government has to take an authoritarian stance and for example enact conscription and taxation measures to keep the country and its people safe. This is neither desirable nor pretty, but it is necessary.'\n- Alexander Hamilton, 1819."
 USA_friendship_with_the_confederation:0 "Friendship with the Confederation"
 USA_friendship_with_the_confederation_desc:0 "Anglo-American relations with the Natives have gotten rather friendly over time - being prevented from genociding them by losing the Great War certainly didn't hurt relations.

 USA_adopt_the_nimitz_plan_desc:0 "Chester William Nimitz was named Supreme Admiral of the U.S. Navy in 1933, in the early days of the Wadsworth administration.

 USA_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marine Corps"
 USA_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "The U.S. Marine Corps has a simple task: Storm a foreign beach, kill enemy bastards, raise a few flags, wait for reinforcements.

 USA_invite_entente_experts_desc:0 "Having aligned with most of the North American democracies, we can now form new research teams and set up research laboratories in our major cities.

 USA_ultimatum_to_ohio:0 "Ultimatum to Ohio"
 USA_ultimatum_to_ohio_desc:0 "Ohio was established by the French in 1814, using to their advantage the many crown-loyalists fleeing from the U.S. after the Revolutionary War. France installed the British king in the anticipation of a possibility that they might ever need him for something.

 USA_request_the_great_lakes_region:0 "Request the Great Lakes Region"
 USA_request_the_great_lakes_region_desc:0 "Now that we are allied with France, we have lost our route of expansion to the west. Perhaps we should just ask the French whether or not they would be willing to turn over Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin?"
 USA_the_louisiana_gamble:0 "The Louisiana Gamble"
 USA_the_louisiana_gamble_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Region is rightfully American. The French are not gonna hand it over though, so how about we just march in and see whether or not they actually have a valid response?"
 USA_american_idealism:0 "American Idealism"
 USA_american_idealism_desc:0 "The Democratic Party of the United States consistently demands the U.S. to turn its back on France and to align more with countries like Austria and even neighboring Ohio. The Democratic leadership argues that the French-led Entente are dangerous and ultimately the enemy of American expansion and nationalism. They propose the 'American Security Act' to counter French aggression in North America."
 USA_friendship_with_california:0 "Friendship with California"
 USA_friendship_with_california_desc:0 "California and the United States are often called 'sister republics' due to their close linguistic and cultural similitaries. California is often shown as an example of isolationist francophobia in the style that the Democratic Party would like for the country. Now that the U.S. too has accepted a course weary of France, perhaps approaching California is at last in order?"
 USA_army_focus:0 "Army Focus"
 USA_army_focus_desc:0 "The U.S. Army keeps the country safe from a possible French invasion. This threat is far more real than many American citizens realize, and the U.S. Army is currently inadequate to deal with a massive colonial empire kicking in our front door. This is especially concerning considering France could not only kick in the front door, but also the back door or side door or any other door. We are surrounded!"
 USA_embrace_the_corporatists:0 "Embrace the Corporatists"

 USA_create_the_us_foreign_legion:0 "Create the U.S. Foreign Legion"
 USA_create_the_us_foreign_legion_desc:0 "The French are annoying 'cretins', as they would put it, but their practice of introducing foreign peoples - especially poor immigrants - into the armed forces is genius. They are desperate, hence they are loyal. They don't have family that will miss them if they fall in combat, and sending non-Americans into war will concern the public far less than wasting U.S. servicemen."
 USA_expand_the_ranger_corps:0 "Expand the Ranger Corps"
 USA_expand_the_ranger_corps_desc:0 "The U.S. Army Rangers are a vital tool to American interests. They can drop behind enemy frontlines efficiently and quickly, enabling further attacks by regular infantry units. The paratrooper abilities of the U.S. Army need to be expanded."
 USA_expand_ford:0 "Expand Ford"
 USA_expand_ford_desc:0 "Although the Ford corporation is apparantly in open conspiracy against the U.S. government, we still have to acknowledge that they make up for more than a twentieth of America's export economy just on their own.

 USA_create_the_freedom_league:0 "Create the Freedom League"
 USA_create_the_freedom_league_desc:0 "A splinter group within the Republican Party has proposed a new 'American counterweight' to the French entente in North America, hoping for a good-neighbor relationship between the two subsequent factions of democracies. Now that the U.S. has decided against direct alignment with France, we might have to think about this plan another time."
 USA_north_american_free_trade:0 "North American Free Trade"
 USA_north_american_free_trade_desc:0 "One of the key demand of the anti-French Republican factions is the realization of a 1921 proposal of a "North American Free Trade League", for all non-communist governments in North America to form a low-tariff zone of economic exchange. The offer compared to its 1921 original should probably be expanded to South America as well though."

 USA_offer_statehood_to_california_desc:0 "California was a country created both by American settlers expelled from northern Mexico, from the native lands and from Louisiana as well as from Anglo-Canadians fleeing the Quebecois takeover of the northern part of the continent.

 USA_jacksonian_idealism:0 "Jacksonian Idealism"
 USA_jacksonian_idealism_desc:0 "Andrew Jackson, 3rd President of the United States between 1832 and 1836, is considered the father of modern American conservatism. Originally a populist stepping up for the rights of southern whites, he reformed the 1823 "Freemens' Party" into his personal "Democratic Party" of 1831. A defender of white exceptionalism and the institution of slavery, Jackson is still a historical favorite of modern Democrats."
 USA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
 USA_ruralism_desc:0 "The concept of "ruralism" goes back to the first two Democratic Presidents, Andrew Jackson (1832-1836) and James Buchanan (1856-1860).

 USA_embrace_urban_northerners:0 "Embrace Urban Northerners"
 USA_embrace_urban_northerners_desc:0 "No matter how important the American agricultural output is to the nation and to its culture, one has to recognize that a modern nation needs industrial workers and a strong industrial base.

 USA_ideological_reform:0 "Ideological Reform"

 USA_endorse_the_anti_fascists:0 "Endorse the Anti-Fascists"
 USA_endorse_the_anti_fascists_desc:0 "Ideological reformism is good and all, but these corrupt fascistic businesspeople secretly running our government just don't sit well with us. They need to be purged here or there."

 USA_invite_henry_ford_into_the_government_desc:0 "America is a country built on business. Henry Ford did right to influence the U.S. government with his money - that's how the free market works. Ford and his Manifest Destiny Party should be called forth to support and stabilize our government."

 USA_adopt_the_lindbergh_plan_desc:0 "Charles A. Lindbergh, a committed supporter of the Manifest Destiny Party, has proposed a creation of industrial jobs through the exploitation of natural resources.
