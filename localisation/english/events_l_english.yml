 AUS.1.t:0 "The Empire of Austria"
 AUS.1.d:0 "Only a few of the world's old monarchies still hold on to the values of the 'Divine Mandate', but among these kingships of old you will find the Kaisertum Österreich, the Empire of Austria.\n\nRuled by two subsequent reactionary emperors, Franz Joseph I and Franz Ferdinand I, Austria has failed to reform as the world did. The army is outdated and its intake of officers limited to ethnic Germans, the local parliaments are classified as different levels of federal subjects, with the parliaments of Austria and Bohemia being valued higher than the others - much to the dismay of the various Poles, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Romanians, Hungarians, Italians, Slovenians, Croatians, Bosnians and Serbians the Austrian Empire has absorbed since its victory in the Great War of 1756.\n\nAustria is way past its breaking point. The Hungarians rebelled in two major and five minor uprisings, the Austrian Romanians tried to reunite with Romania as recently as 1926 and the various Slavic ethnicities find themselves supported again and again by Russian secret agents hoping to disassemble the Austrian Empire and to regain Russian access to the Balkans.\n\nAustria is in a precarious spot. The alliance with France is failing due to France's refusal to look past Austria's reactionary principles, Prussia appears to be on the up and up again with a rejuvenated military and political presence, Russia is trying to reduce the number of foreign threats by taking apart foreign great powers on its border in order to assure that said empires won't help Russia's internal enemies.\n\nBut Austria has found a new friend among these troubles. It is unbelievable considering the attacks on Vienna that this country has conducted in the past, but perhaps, the Ottoman Turks, just as reactionary, traditionalistic and plagued by ethnic minorities as Austria is, would now make Austria's most promising friend for the immediate future. But allying with the Ottomans would put the last nail into the coffin of the Austro-French alliance of old. Franz Ferdinand needs to consider his choices carefully."

Russia currently does not see itself in the position to help the government of the dangerous fool [ROM.GetLeader] out of the position they themselves got into by their own fault."\nThis is a shock, as it marks Russia's unwillingness to protect a Balkan state from Austrian or Ottoman influence - a move that could end up jeopardizing the independence of Serbia and Montenegro as well."

 BAY.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Bavaria"
 BAY.1.d:0 "The Austrian victory over Prussia cemented the Habsburg claim as leader of the mosaic of loose German dukedoms, counties and kingdoms - and Bavaria has always been Austria's closest ally. Even Vienna's disastrous defeat at French hands in the Belgian War or Francis II's ineptitude to stop France from advancing her frontier well into the Holy Roman Empire's traditional territory, right up to the Rhine river, did not cause Bavaria's loyalty to faulter. And as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded by Francis II, who subsequently became Francis I, Emperor of Austria, Bavaria went along for the ride, with the various royal governments in Munich arguing again and again that to go with the flow was preferable than to be crushed at Habsburg hands and directly annexed into Austria's realm.\n\nThe Kings of Bavaria have since the early 1820s preferred to take a backseat to their Prime Ministers, allowing elections and popular will to guide the Bavarian Assembly, which in turn guides the responsibilities of state. The Bavarian elite has however refused to tie the monarchy to a constitution, going against the example of the other German states, most of whom followed the French model of constitutional monarchism.\n\nBavaria continues its loyalty to Austria's foreign policy position, with King Rupprecht of Bavaria having assured Franz Ferdinand of both his personal and Bavaria's national loyalty to the Habsburg cause at an official event between the two powers in Vienna in 1932. King Rupprecht, who survived a communist assassin's attempt to kill him in 1934, appointed the hyper-conservative Georg Stang the Prime Minister of Bavaria in May of 1935, after Stang's Bavarian People's Party won the elections in April of the same year, partially on the promises of avenging the attempt on the King's life by massively cracking down on Eugen Leviné's bolshevik movement."

 BAY.2.d:0 "King Rupprecht of Bavaria has held an understandable grudge against the Bavarian bolshevik movement ever since a member of the "red resistance" group tried to kill him in 1934.\n\nHowever, it is a relatively recent development that the king actively participates in anti-communist political events. While the staunch monarchists around [BAV.GetLeader] greet this development as helpful in putting down the "revolutionary radicals", as they call them, especially the democratic-liberal opposition has warned that allowing these actions to proceed might inspire an active turn of the bolsheviks against the Bavarian monarchy. The democrats insist that the current moderation of the communists in beneficial, and actively radicalizing them in their militancy would only do harm to the country."

 BAY.3.t:0 "Drexler murdered"
 BAY.3.d:0 "Anton Drexler, leader of the fascistic Bayrische Arbeiterpartei since 1917, has been found murdered in his Unterhaching home. The assassins that killed him did not make a secret of his death, propping the dead body up on a chair locking the front door open, for all neighbors to see. The brutal type of the killing - a slashed throat after what appears to be a considerable amount and time of torture, including castration - bears the handwriting of the Württembergian fascists moreso than the Bavarian communists, who would have been the most obvious suspect for the killing otherwise.\n"While the despised Mr Drexler in life and will not mourn him in death, the Bavarian workers' movement has as little to do with this killing as it had with the attempt on the king's life.", a press release of the Bavarian People's Revolutionary Party announced.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit pointing to Württembergian involvement is the fact that Württemberg's dictator Rosenberg despised Drexler, who refused to acknowledge Rosenberg's völkisch movement - and thus Rosenberg himself - as the rightful leader of a fascistic German union. Drexler instead propagated an independent fascistic Bavaria that would have benefitted both from German and Austrian friendship in the case of German unification outside of Bavaria. Even more damning is the fact that Drexler's former deputy, fascistic orator and moderately successful artist Adolf Hitler, is far more willing to accept Rosenbergian claims to all-German leadership including Bavaria. Hitler, now in charge of the party, is a more appealing face than Drexler was, but his message is unlikely to please many Bavarians, most of whom distrust unification efforts with the less catholic, less conservative and less monarchical northern and western German states."
 BAY.3.o1:0 "Let's see what this Hitler guy has in store."
 BAY.4.t:0 "Beer Hall Rally"
 BAY.4.d:0 "It has only been a few weeks since Adolf Hitler took charge of the Bavarian Workers' Party, and the man has already produced stunning results. The party reports a significant increase in membership numbers, celebrating the new "Bavarian Führer". The party leadership also published a joint essay regarding alleged communist plans to assassinate Hitler, something that the Bavarian communists have denied upon a police inquiry regarding the potential threat. The local communist leader in Nuremberg is quoted saying "Hitler is a fad, destined to fail. We wouldn't even kill him if political assassination was part of our modus operandi, which it isn't."\n\nRegardless of communists plots on Hitler's life or the lack thereof, Bavarian fascism seems to be making a political comeback. A recent rally in a Munich beer hall drew more than 2,000 listeners and had to be interrupted and taken outside of the building because of safety concerns. Especially that last fact is being used as propaganda by the fascists in a very big and self-congratulating way."

 BRA.1.t:0 "The Brazilian Republic"
 BRA.1.d:0 "Sometimes being called the 'grandfather of Latin America', Brazil was the first of the Iberian colonies to gain independence, with the Portuguese-appointed governor being ousted in October of 1822, a national assembly forming by November and the Declaration of Independence being passed on December 24th, 1822. Partially caused by Portuguese weakness since their defeat in the Great War of 1756 and partially by their more immediate defeat in the Spanish-Portuguese War of 1820, Brazil had felt like being part of Portugal would drag her down. Subsequently, a somewhat unstable democratic republic was established - the attempt by one the Portuguese King's relatives to become a monarch of Brazil was repelled by the national assembly. Brazil immediately became a sworn enemy of Spain, just like her mother country Portugal had been, with Brazil attempting to support independence movements in the various South American colonies of Spain - but the Brazil-backed attempt by one Simon Bolivar only lead to a crushing defeat for the colonists and Bolivar's execution. It would take until the Spanish communist revolution for Chile to become the first Spanish-speaking country to break free from the colonial yoke in April of 1872.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil had been a mess. With an economy entirely dependent of slavery, the French government's continued action to end the practice in the entire world was a great pain to the Brazilian elites. After France even forced the United States to abolish slavery in 1870, it turned its sights on Brazil, imposing humiliating and back-breaking sanctions on the country, sometimes known as the 'Big Blockade' in Brazil or the 'Glorious Blockade' in France. Eventually, a slave revolt in 1879 saw French troops landing on the Brazilian coast to end slavery by force - the Brazilian government complied, banning the acquisition of new slaves in 1880 and setting all slaves free by 1891, becoming the second to last country to abolish the practice in South America, with only the Andean Republic holding on to it longer.\n\nMore recently, Brazil has once again fallen into economic despair, with the job crisis of 1917 leading to the economic collapse of 1921 and the 'dark decade' that were the 1920s. In the wake of that event, an authoritarian military-backed strongman and committed free-market capitalist, Getulio Vargas, took power in the country. Convinced that democracy is reeking of socialism and weakens the economy just by its existance, Vargas has established a new form of fascism, the 'state corporatist' ideology."

 ENG.1.t:0 "The British Republic"
 ENG.1.d:0 "The disastrous defeat in the Great War between 1756 and 1767 has sent Britain on a continuous downward spiral of humiliation over the past one and a half centuries. The war cost Britain dearly: In North America, she was restrained to the Thirteen Colonies and had to give up the rest of the territory to the Native American tribes allied with Britain's enemies, which effectively meant ceding them to France. The French, the Austrians and the Russians dismantled Britain's most promising ally on the continent, Prussia. Massive reparation payments were demanded and the British crown ended up in amounts of debt the likes of which had never been seen before. What followed were taxation and tyranny of the British king, George III. The British people, starving and impoverished, went to revolution in 1809. The British revolution saw George III and his heir, George IV, removed from their positions and swiftly executed. The instability of the British state proved an opportunity to the colonial population of the Thirteen Colonies, which waged a revolutionary war against the British colonial elite between 1811 and 1813. This American Revolution - heavily supported by the French - saw the 'United States of America' break away from Britain.\n\nSince then, the republic has been a secondary power on the European continent, even though its navy remains a sight to behold. British colonial presence was partially rebuilt in Australia and on the Arabian peninsula, but attempts to establish a new foothold in Africa led to political conflict with Britain's only stable ally, Prussia, leading to Britain choosing to stay out of the black continent.\n\nA stable democracy, the republic is looking to rejoin the ranks of the great powers of earth. However, internally, especially the upper classes and the conservatives still disagree with the fabric of a republic. They still favor the current pretender to the throne - who would be George V, who has been propped up as the 'King of Ohio' by the French - over the republican government in London."

 ENG.2.d:0 "British ultranationalists had not been properly unified and had not been able to form a common political front until Austen Chamberlain defected from the Conservative Party in 1921 and proposed a fusion of various British splinter movements consisting of nationalists, fascists, neo-imperialists, radical monarchists and religious fundamentalists. By the will and determination of Chamberlain alone, most British far-right parties merged into the 'British National Front', the BNF, between 1922 and 1925. In 1928, the BNF eventually rebranded itself the AoNF, the 'Alliance of Nationalists and Fascists'.\n\nChamberlain had been confirmed as head of the party in 1925 and, after being confirmed once in 1930, proclaimed himself 'führer' of the movement in the style of Alfred Rosenberg's Württembergian völkisch movement in 1932, cancelling internal party elections and elevating his own position to an indefinite one.\n\nMost far-right activists stayed loyal to their leader, fearing the return of the messy political situation of the 1910s where nationalists stood broken and divided against an ever-growing Radical Labor Party.\n\nBut now, it seems that old age, stress and sickness finally got to Chamberlain. He reinstated party elections, calling the next one for a date just one month from now. The reason appears to be his imminent resignation and the need to find a proper political heir."

Mosley, who is fluent in German, describes himself as a 'committed völkisch Rosenbergian' and describes a possible future alliance between a united völkisch Germany and a fascistic British Republic. Mosley, who after receiving an honorary degree with distinction in Suttgart university had also travelled to the Kingdom of Naples and inspected the power structure established by Achille Starace's fascistic movement there, dreams of a 'Stuttgart-Rome-London Axis' and an Italian-British-German alliance to eventually subjugate all of Europe and the world.\n\nMosley succeeded in the vote during the leadership struggle against Harmsworth, winning with a 14.88% margin.

The party leadership of AoNF responded by announcing that Harmsworth would have to face execution upon the AoNF's inevitable takeover of the British government.\n\nMeanwhile, Harmsworth has found new political allies: The Royalist Society. Harmsworth has given a lengthy speech about how the ultranationalistic legacy of Austen Chamberlain could no longer be found among the ranks of the 'German-loving anti-British' AoNF and that the more moderate Royalist Society would be the new home for classical ultranationalists like himself.\n\nThe Daily Mail this morning printed a picture of the King of Ohio titled 'Long live our rightful King!'."

 CAL.1.t:0 "The Californian Republic"
 CAL.1.d:0 "California started out as a no man's land and refugee territory after the British defeat in the Great War of 1756, when the victorious French forces and their Native American allies started to evict Anglo settlers from Louisiana and Canada. Due to the small number of said English-speaking settlers however, no true Californian society was able to form and only small cities of a few thousand inhabitants formed at spots that would eventually become Seattle, Portland and other cities. At that point in time, around the year 1800, the terms 'Free Citizens' or 'Freemen' was in use for these stateless adventurers that would often have their city mayors as their highest elected officials and form small armed militias from among the tiny populations of the cities. Only with the American Revolution of 1813, when nationalistic fervor and the feelings of brotherhood with the now independent United States swept from the east coast of the continent to the west did cities start to band together into a loose confederation of what was sometimes called the 'United Western States'. This UWS eventually ended up giving itself a constitution in 1819, whereupon its name was officially and conclusively changed to 'Californian Republic'. The young state faced a powerful adversary in the Spanish Empire, but overcame that foe in the Californian War started in December 1830, after which Spain was forced to sign a humiliating territorial concession treaty with the Californians.\n\nSince then, California has been a strong and proud democracy, but was never able to completely throw off the colonial yoke, mainly in the form of French influence. Although the gold rush of 1845 gave the country a decent population boost, it still heavily depends on European trade and relies on agricultural imports to stay alive. California was able to score a few additional diplomatic victories after the Californian War, forcing the Kingdom of Hawaii to first become a republic in 1887 and then to eventually join the Californian federated republic as an autonomous state in 1894, all just by economic pressure on the archipelago. California did however lose the bidding war with Quebec regarding Alaska, ultimately discarding the territory as a useless endeavor as Alaska obviously holds no natural resources to speak of.\n\nWilliam Stephens is the newest President of California, preaching economic liberalism, diplomatic pacifism and friendship to both France and the United States.

 CHI.1.t:0 "The Republic of China"
 CHI.1.d:0 "The Japanese Invasion of 1897, known as the 'First Sino-Japanese War' in the west, the 'Glorious Invasion of Emperor Meiji' in Japan and the 'First Hour of National Disgrace' in China, led to the complete and utter collapse of the Chinese imperial system which had led the country over various dynasties through the last 3 millennia.\n\nSubsequently, a Chinese republic was established and quickly gained political movements as diverse as the Chinese population itself, with the rural lower classes favoring communist and democratic reformers, whereas the urban middle-class sought its fortune with the authoritarian Kuomintang around Sun Yat-sen. Sun Yat-sen became China's first strongman after defeating the communists and democrats in a power struggle and went on to integrate most of the local warlords into his fletchling republic. However, the second Japanese Invasion of 1925 put an end to the harmony. The military action by the Japanese Empire quickly became the 'Second Hour of National Disgrace', as the north-eastern provinces of the country were taken from China. Sun Yat-sen, weakened by stress and sickness, died during the war, leaving a power vacuum. His political heir, Chiang Kai-shek, tried to maintain Yat-sen's 'Three Principles of the People' and to wage the war, but a rebel group around Hu Hanmin left the Kuomintang, united the most effective units of the Chinese military under their banner and toppled Kai-shek, who was forced into exile in French Indochina. Hanmin, confronted with the realities of being China's leader, had to agree to a truce with Japan, but made it no secret that not only would there be no further Japanese incursions, but that Manchuria's situation under Japanese governance was to be short-lived.\n\nNow, the 'Great Leader of the Republic', as Hanmin styles himself, has fallen ill. Will he survive his sickness? And if not, will another power vacuum give rise to a Third Hour of National Disgrace? Or will China emerge stronger than ever?"

As the SSM only handed these approvals to their own events, the Kuomintang and the CCP effectively were no longer allowed to operate (even though that had already been pretty much true for the CCP for a few years at that point).\n\nChiang Kai-Shek, in defiance of the order, organized a march of the Kuomintang in Shanghai, and more than 40,000 Chinese anti-fascists came out to support it a few days ago. While the local authorities wisely avoided civil war by allowing the march to proceed, the entire leadership has been now detained, including Chiang Kai-Shek, who was arrested when he tried to cross a roadside checkpoint on the 'southwestern frontier', beyond which the feudal warlords of Yunnan hold control.\n\nKai-Shek is currently being dragged back to the capital, but we can already prepare his verdict that he is to receive for his gross defiance of our orders - going too soft on him might strengthen the cause of the Kuomintang."

 finland.1.d:0 "The Finnish people switched from Swedish to Russian overlordship after the two Swedish-Russian Wars of 1804-1806 ("Finland War") and 1816-1821 ("Aland War"), both of which ended in crushing Swedish defeats. Finland was ruled by a Russian governor for most of its time under Tsarist control, with the Finnish language being supressed and the dominant Finnish faith, lutheranism, being increasingly entrenched by Russian Orthodoxy. Even Finland's only two universities, in Helsinki and Turku, were forced to accept a certain quota of Russian and Baltic students and hold their lectures exclusively in Russian. Novelties like motorways, railroads and airports were for a long time kept only to "greatly loyal and God-fearing regions", as the Russians called it. As a logical conclusion, the agitated Finnish people were more than willing to put their faith into the Bolshevik calls to arms, and Finnish insurgents made up significant amounts of the communist forces in all three insurgencies (1896, 1907-1908, 1923-1924). Even non-communists joined the Bolsheviks, just hoping to destabilize Russia so much that no more actual political control could be exerted by St Petersburg over Finland.\n\nDue to that fact, the Russian government recently decided to grant Finland a limited autonomy in the Poland-Finland Government Act in April of 1925. Although the Tsar did not do so without taking significant bites out of Finland's and Poland's territories, Helsinki and Warsaw now have the right to have soldiers of their nations only serve under officers also of their nation, replacing Russian as the language of military command. Also, both countries get the right to certain religious autonomies, ending the yoke of the Orthodox Church on Polish catholicism and Finnish lutheranism for the moment.\n\nBut the Tsar cannot be trusted. Finland is no longer the lap dog of some foreign European despot. Finland chose for itself to be guided not by a random ethnically Finnish nobleman, as the Tsar had suggested, and had instead emulated the western European model of parliamentary democracy with free and fair elections for all male citizens over the age of 25. In a recent outrage, Russian secret police arrested several keynote speakers in the Finnish parliament. A young man by the name of Urho Kekkonen was even dragged off stage in the midst of a speech in which he demanded the Finnish administration start talks with the Swedish and French governments to gain support for an independence referendum in the style of what had worked in Norway in 1894. Kekkonen still has not been returned from the Russian secret prison he is probably being held in, causing several days of worker riots in late December of 1935.\n\nThe Finns demand independence, and they demand it now."

 FRA.1.t:0 "The French Imperial Federation"
 FRA.1.d:0 "France's history since the Great War of 1756 to 1767 can be described as "never-ending victory". The French have asserted themselves as the leading power of the world and have especially their talented political leadership to thank for their continued spot of the greatest power on earth. After defeating Prussia and the United Kingdom in the Great War, France supported revolutionary ambition in the remaining British colonies in North America and helped them to gain independence in the American Revolution of 1811. During these events, they also supported popular uprising in Britain itself, backing the British Revolution against the crown between 1810 and 1813. This gamble proved to be ultimately meaningless, as the resulting British Republic was just as hostile to France than its predecessor, the United Kingdom, was.\n\nFrance continued colonial dominance of the world, gaining footholds in Africa, China and South East Asia. Avoiding major military conflict since the Great War, France managed mainly with minor and quick campaigns to surround itself with a multitude of buffer states in Germany and the Netherlands. However, the French policy of using the Rhine river as its natural border did not go over well with the German and Dutch peoples, many of whom now living under French supremacy. Revolutionary fervor did not only affect the foreign peoples under French rule however, with even the ethnically French population groups quickly becoming annoyed with the French monarchy in the first half of the 19th Century. After three violent uprisings against the most reactionary King Louis XVII between 1836 and 1849, the king's death gave way to his more liberal son, Louis XVIII, to dismantle the Estates General and to effectively abolish the concept of 'Divine Mandate' as well as the unlimited power of the French monarch. Louis XVIII is seen as the main reason France's empire did not crumble due to its outdated political outlooks and the French doctrine since then has been one of a moderate constitutional monarchy where effectively all power lies with the parliament in Paris. France has also taken steps to give greater autonomy to its colonial subjects, establishing local rulers in Congo and Kenya, both former colonial possessions of France. Over this policy, King Louis XXI proposed in 1924 that the 'French Empire' be renamed to 'French Imperial Federation' to give more acknowledgement to the non-French peoples within the realm.\n\nFrance has a plethora of enemies: The Prussians, the British, the Dutch, even China has recently joined a group of nations with an openly anti-French foreign policy doctrine.

Why? Simple: To keep the Balkans fractured and weak and, as some others would argue, to keep the Ottomans, Austrians and Russians at odds with each other in this hotspot just so France could rule the world alone.\n\nThe Balkan states have begun seeking alignment with foreign powers: After Serbia joined a permanent alliance with the Russian Empire, Montenegro answered by an entry into the French alliance system. Romania, initially friendly to the Russians and Serbians, recently turned communist, with Russia and Austria preventing each other from intervening against the new far-left government. Greece has maintained a careful neutrality with clear signs of alignment towards France and has mainly focussed on defense and security.

Most recently, Guatemala made headlines on May 1st, 1933, when former elementary school teacher María Chinchilla Recinos became the first elected female head of state in human history at the young age of 26. Guatemala has subsequently been ridiculed especially in the press of the neighboring country of El Salvador, whose society is still highly patriarchal, but Recinos has in her term as President overseen a massive education reform that is projected to bump literacy from 76% in 1930 to at least 90% by 1945. With communism on Guatemala's western border and fascism and military authoritarianism to her east, Recinos has tried to gain the international support of western democracies, including the United States, California and France.

 HAN.1.t:0 "The Revolutionary Republic of Hannover"
 HAN.1.d:0 "Hannover is one of the traditional minor states of northern Germany. After the fall of the British monarchy, the personal union between the UK and Hannover ended abruptly, tossing the country into decades as a Prussian puppet state. Only the Prussian constitution of 1834 gave Hannover a semblance of sovereignity when the absolute power of the Hohenzollern dynasty in Prussia was taken a step back. The 'Heimatschutzgesetz', the home protection law, of 1849 saw the re-establishment of a judiciary system independent from Berlin. In 1856, the Prussian law code was replaced with an adapted Hanoverian one, leading the country to independence as an ally of Prussia. Since then, a reactionary right-wing government ruled Hannover - until 1921, when a coalition of anarchists, radical socialists, moderate social democrats and totalitarian communists toppled the old regime and took power. Prussian military intervention seemed inevitable, but was prevented when sixteen French battleships showed up off the coast of Pomerania to remind the Prussians of the proceedings of the 1906 Four Powers Conference, in which the great powers of Europe agreed to stay out of the affairs of the small German states. The threat of war had Prussia back down - and Hannover was established as a communist state through a series of purges of the more moderate revolutionary forces, including the anarchists and social democrats.\n\nThe 'All-German Communist Congress' has since been etablished in the city of Hannover, quickly becoming the world capital of communism. Vladimir Lenin, seeking refuge from the Russian Tsar, is among the multiple notorious personalities currently in Hannover. The far-left states of the world, like Italy, Spain, the Caribbean Confederation, Romania and Mexico, all have established diplomatic missions in Hannover, resulting in numerous - so far unsuccessful - talks of a Communist International being established between the powers.\n\n[HAN.GetLeader] has recently taken over as Secretary-General of the Socialist Revolutionary Party of Hannover.

 HES.1.t:0 "The Duchy of Hesse"
 HES.1.d:0 "Hesse has since the Rhine Wars of 1806, in which the French Kingdom relocated its eastern and northern border to the Rhine river, constantly lived in the shadow of France.\n\nHesse went out of its way to play all three sides of the triangular rivalry between Austria, France and Prussia that followed, but was surprised when Francis II of Austria disbanded the weakened Holy Roman Empire in 1817 to instead focus on his new title as Emperor of Austria. The Hessian monarchy, which had through several royal marriages united its dynasty with the former ruling house of the now defunct Duchy of the Palatinate, whose entire territory had been annexed by France, passed a 'Hessian-Palatine Unity Law' in 1821, in which it declared the two countries had formed a union. The French King Louis XVII would during the 1830s force Hesse to revoke any territorial claims made through that decree, but the German population of the Palatinate had nonetheless begun thinking of themselves as in a state of union with Hesse, calling themselves 'Pfalzhessen' (Palatine Hessians) or 'Linksrheinhessen' (Hessians to the left of the Rhine).\n\nThe Duchy of Hesse was forced into government reform when the next French king, Louis XVIII, the 'reformer king', embraced enlightenment values and democratic structures of government in the 1850s and 1860s. Since then, the Hessian Landtag has been sovereign of the realm, with the Duke taking a ceremonial role instead. Hesse has joined the 'Dreibrüderabkommen', the treaty of three brothers, with Baden and Westphalia in 1911. All three countries promised to stay true to democratic values and constitutional rights for their citizens, and France, overseer of the treaty, promised in return to provide them with military protection if under attack by a foreign power.\n\nMost recently, Hesse has seen an upset in its political daily life, as the fascistic völkisch movement is gaining a lot of attention and popularity. The national socialists around Ferdinand Werner are considered the 'second strongest nationalistic movement in Germany, only outdone by Württemberg itself'. Katharina Roth and her communists, allied with Hannover to the north, were not as successful, but are still considered a looming threat."

This 'Landmann Initiative', named for Prime Minister Ludwig Landmann, has sought national and international companies vying for valuable government grants and tax cuts; even French and British companies showed interest in the possible expansions. However, two local businessmen have clearly presented the best pitch:\nOn one side, there is Moritz Otschi, a noted industrial magnate and believer in civilian models of economic growth, who has offered to expand Hessian heavy industry, especially the automotive sector, with massive investments in his Otschi-Werke in order to especially draw agricultural workers of the north to the urban centers of the south.\nOn the other hand, the illustrious nobleman Dennis von Adler has instead insisted on a military route by investing the government money in his military company 'Adler-Werke'. Adler-Werke is mainly a producer of fighter planes that even gained international approval, but the company has more recently also expanded to include the logistics and know-how of military airfield construction and has begun investing in the sector of anti-aircraft guns.\n\nBoth companies are highly promising. Who should our government grants go to?"

 RAJ.1.t:0 "The Republic of Hyderabad"
 RAJ.1.d:0 "The Indian heartlands are rich in natural resources, something craved by European colonial powers. In both the Bombay Conference of 1860 and the Pondicherry Conference of 1911, the Europeans - mainly Britain, France, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, but also interested investors from Prussia, Russia, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey - tried to prevent the European juggernauts from going to war "over some damn foolish thing in the orient", as Prussian envoy Otto von Bismarck called it in Bombay.\n\nAs a result of the 1860 Conference, the Europeans agreed to respect nominal Mughal control of northern India and the establishment of a free-trade zone and merchant republic in the Tamil region, but it would take until the Pondicherry Treaty of 1911 that the various colonial boundaries reaching deep into India were to be cut back to only the central coastal cities that the Europeans controlled. The rest of the territory was granted to the "Republic of Hyderabad", under the control of the colonial powers' joint JCAZ (Joint Colonial Administration Zone) government.\n\nSince then, exploitation of natural resources functions on a level of international diplomacy, but the lack of European war threats does not help feeding the unruly Indian locals. Many of them seek some sort of "Hindustani solution", a political term for the dream of a unification of the Hindu states of Jabalpur, Gujarat, Hyderabad and Tamil as well as the majority-Hindu regions of the Mughal Empire to merge into one "Republic of Hindustan".\n\nBut for now, Hyderabad is merely a pawn on the European chessboards."

 ITA.1.t:0 "The Republic of Italy"
 ITA.1.d:0 "The state of 'Italy' was designed by the French to be a chesspiece against the Austrians. In a series of military conflicts, a Franco-Sardinian coalition marched through the northern Italian countryside, capturing city after city for the King of Sardinia and Piedmont. France mainly aimed to create a French-aligned partner against the Austrians, who had recently taken control of the Veneto region in Italy's north-east. France had however denied Italy the right to seize Rome, instead choosing to also prop up the Papal States and the southern Kingdom of Naples, with the three countries sometimes being called the 'Italian Triumvirate' by politicians to mark their special relationship. What they did not anticipate was the fascistic coup in Naples in the early 1920s and the electoral victory by the Italian far-left in the north.\n\nIn only the past few years, the radical Togliatti administration has forced the King of Italy into exile, has removed catholicism as the state religion and replaced it with a doctrine of 'secular atheism' and is now aiming to establish a one-party state in the north, even though even within the communist parties there is so-called 'reformist' faction that wishes to maintain democratic elections and democracy as a whole. The Togliatti administration has led Italy into a military pact with communist Spain, a country revered by the communist 'hardliners', as the anti-democratic forces are called. Now, Italy is surrounded by its political enemy in Austria, its religious-ideological enemy in the Papal State, its disappointed former ally France and a Republic of Switzerland that is as neutral as one can imagine but that has still made point to reject communism wherever possible.\n\nCan the revolution last?"

Still, they remain without representation in Senate and Parliament - mostly due to the resistance of both noncommunist forces as well as large parts of the Moderati and the Bolscevichi -, and the tribunus plebis, Mahmud al-Muntasir, has brought the issue to the core of the communist party by overseeing the foundation of the 'Gruppo Libico', the Libyan Group. This has since developed into the Libyan Communist Caucus, a group of Libyan-born Italians that joined the PCI when on the Italian mainland and that would like to extend full emancipation to the colonial people of western Libya. They are in that strife supported decisively by the Globalisti and the 10 members of the Libyan Communist Caucus would most likely support them if allowed to enter the convention.

Most of these points can be boiled down to the sudden and immediate destruction of communist rule and policies. The CU has also called openly for several prosecutions and arrests of high-ranking party members - a first in a political program.\n\nThe CU's first political action is a march of hundreds of thousands, particularly from their various youth organizations, in Bologna against the PCI and their convention.

Antonio Gramsci, the leader of the Globalisti, has called for Mussolini's eviction from the party and banishment from the country, whereas Giuseppe Saragat of the Protettori has accused him of being more of a fascist than he ever was a communist and suggested to him to try out the lifestyle he advocates by just moving to Starace's Naples and never returning.\n\nThings are getting heated."

This marks a gross violation of Swiss law which explicitly states that none of the cantons may be threatened on their own territory with annexiation into another canton or country.\n\nThe arrest of Farinacci and his goons was no doubt legal under Swiss law, so their seats at the convention will henceforth be vacant.

The Americans broke away in 1811 and Iran seized British port cities at its southern shore in 1812.\n\nFor Ireland however, the path to independence was to be longer. Due to the proximity to the island of Great Britain and due to the revolutionaries' feeling of connectedness to the Anglo-Irish and Ulster-Scots populations, the National Council overseeing the revolutionary efforts declared an intervention in Ireland, bringing several thousands of British troops to Ireland in September 1813. This "September Landing" marked the beginning of several painful defeats for the Irish rebels seeking independence, losing the Battle of Dublin on November 11th and the Battle of Cork on December 25th.\n\nThe leadership of the secessionists retreated to Galway and asked for international assistance. Both France and the freshly independent United States sent several shiploads of weapons to assist the Irish in their struggle, but neither party declared war on the revolutionaries. The Irish secessionists were forced into a defensive standoff with the English troops until the summer of 1816, when Nelson's Revolt shattered the lines of the British armed forces. British naval commander Horatio Nelson had turned on the increasingly radical British revolutionary leadership, rallying a third of the navy and a fourth of the army to his banners. Nelson's goal - the restoration of the monarchy - proved a more imminent threat to the British than the ragtag Irish force, and London recalled most of its force. Seizing the moment, the Irish army marched eastwards, taking back Dublin on August 2nd, 1816. On August 12th, Cork was reclaimed, and on August 29th, the last British soldiers were forced to board their ships and head back to Great Britain. They were not to return - although the British revolutionaries never declared a peace or ceasefire, they also didn't attempt to bring Ireland back into the fold. In 1824, the first trade treaty between the two nations marked the definite end of hostilities.\n\nSince then, Ireland has held Britain at a cold distance, fearing the Englishman's return under the pretext of defending the descendants of the Anglican colonists that previously settled in Ulster and Leinster. The Irish have found good partners in both the United States and France and the French government has since 1893 guaranteed Ireland's independence."

 JAP.1.t:0 "The Japanese Empire"
 JAP.1.d:0 "Japan chose a western approach to government in the early 1850s, seeking to imitate the European colonial powers which had come in striking power of her territory. The Japanese society pursued a close relationship with France, Quebec, the Netherlands and California and, emulating Louis XVIII's reforms in France, implemented an enlightened society with a constitutional monarchy in place of Japan's old feudalistic system of shoguns and daimyos.\nHowever, where France embraced an open-minded and liberal approach to world politics due to its ethnically and religiously diverse population groups at home and abroad, Japan remained largely homogenous, with shinto-buddhist ethnic Japanese people easily maintaining their majority of the population. Emperor Meiji focussed on getting the Japanese masses educated and especially on shaping Japan's young men into obedient and loyal subjects of the Japanese Imperial Crown.\nFinally, Japan's attention turned outwards, when the Japanese army invaded China in 1897, much to the surprise of the celestial empire. After conquering Korea and Formosa from the Chinese (and also causing the downfall of the ancient Chinese monarchy), Japan accepted peace, satisfied for the time being, and then set its sights on Russia, causing the Russo-Japanese Crisis with several territorial demands presented to Moscow. Russia, fearful of any major conflict that might cause another bolshevik uprising within its borders, invited the Japanese ambassador to the Moscow Conference of 1900. There, a compromise was found between Japan and Russia that saw Japan acquire island territories in Sakhalin and the Kurils and Russia renounce any ambition in Chinese Manchuria. In exchange, Japan would pay a considerable amount of money and end the persecution of Christians within her borders. Japan, weary of causing an international outcry by refusing the reasonable offer, accepted, scoring another diplomatic victory.\nThen, China came back onto the menu. Shortly after Emperor Yoshihito's death, his son Hirohito went to war with China once more, inflicting military defeat on China again and gaining Manchuria, which Japan had previously cleared of Russian influence.\nThe time is looking good for Japan, but the momentum is slowing. Technocratic ultranationalists around Hu Hanmin took power in China, and the European colonial powers made it clear that the only option for their colonial subject was independence or colonialism, but not participation in a greater Japanese Empire.

 MEX.1.t:0 "The Mexican Socialist Republic"
 MEX.1.d:0 "The United States of Central America, or USCA for short, had in June of 1873 become the fourth country after Chile, Colombia and Peru-Bolivia to declare independence from Spain after the communist takeover in Madrid in February of 1872. The USCA had mainly prepared a joint declaration of independence in order to prevent Spanish retaliation in the style of the state of war declared on Chile, the first country to seek independence. The USCA had never intended to stay together, passing the First Central American Decentralization Act in 1876, which saw the independence of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, leaving only the eventual states of Mexico and the Caribbean Confederation in the union. Mexico eventually filed for a divorce, pushing the second decentralization act through in May of 1879, leaving the Caribbean states the sole members of the USCA, which would eventually officially be rebranded the CC, the Caribbean Confederation.\n\nEven though Mexican independence had been tightly connected with the rise of communism in Spain, far-left ideology would eventually come to Mexico itself, with the communist party taking over the country after an election in September of 1883 and promptly disassembling the unstable democratic system. The Mexican communists were able to stay in power due to quick rekindling with the Spanish motherland as well as the instigation of a coup in the Caribbean Confederation to also turn them to communism in 1885. Mexico and the CC stayed untrusting of Spain however and formed the Socialist Alliance in 1887, outright refusing to invite the Spanish, which would eventually set up the Barcelona Agreement, a military faction of their own.\n\nMexico has since then seen mainly economic stagnation and has barely managed to have the political system hold on, accepting several capitalistic measurements in order to stay afloat. Mexico was not even able to avenge the Californian War of 1830, when territory that was rightfully part of New Spain (and thus Mexico) was taken by white anglo refugees who had settled in the region for decades after the British parts of the North American continent were largely francified. A similar independence movement is active in Texas, where there is another white population group. The Texan Insurgency of 1892 was however successfully subdued after the massacre at the Alamo saw the murder and execution of 8,000 rebels, something that still sours relations with California and the United States to this day."

Austria had originally intended to only liberate Greece while outright annexing Romania, Serbia and Montenegro into the Habsburg realm, but a joint Franco-Russian diplomatic intervention had put a swift end to Vienna's dream of eventually engulfing the entire Balkan peninsula.\n\nRecently, the government of Montenegro has been in crisis, with no coalition being able to gain a majority in parliament; it however looks at least possible that Krsto Popović's democrats might gain the support of a part of the monarchist faction.

 TTS.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Naples"
 TTS.1.d:0 "When Starace forced the King of Naples to appoint him Prime Minister in February of 1924, fascism had at last found its way into Europe. Although the far-right ideologies were historically popular in South America, with the Andean Republic being considered the first fascistic state of history from 1891 onwards, it had long been thought that the various strands of totalitarian nationalism would not be able to catch on in Europe, which compared to South America was more literate, more educated and more pluralistic in culture and diplomacy.\n\nBut this European hybris did not work out for Europe's anti-fascists. When Achille Starace took the King's wife and two of his children hostage to capitalize on the Neapolitan government crisis of December of 1923, the King proved to be a weaker man than his supporters had perhaps hoped for, dismissing the reactionary monarchist that had held the Prime Ministership up until that point and passing the baton to Starace and his fascistic junta.\n\nOver the course of the next three years, Starace eviscerated the Neapolitan social structure. Sicilian autonomy was revoked, religious conversion to Roman Catholicism became mandatory for every citizen from the age of 6 (making Naples the only country with a mandatory religious affiliation) and the shallow democracy that had existed on a local level was completely destroyed, with city mayors now being appointed by regional governors, who in turn were to be appointed by the federal government, which in turn was completely under the control of Achille Starace, the first true all-powerful fascistic dictator in the world - even though he would later be joined by Alfred Rosenberg of Württemberg, perhaps Naples' only true friend on the world stage. For what it's worth, Naples can also rely on a frosty friendship from the pope, with the Papal State being at least less disgusted at Naples than they are at the atheistic north Italian communists. Meanwhile, said northern Italians have struggled with Naples in two minor colonial engagements in Libya in 1928 and 1931 - although war has not fully broken out, the threat of military conflict between the two is very real."

 SOU.1.t:0 "The Native Confederation"
 SOU.1.d:0 "The Roots of the alliance between American Indians and the French Empire are to be found in the participation of the Wabanaki, Algonquin, Lenape and other tribes in the Great War of 1756 against the English imperialists. Armed with French rifles, overseen by French commanders and cared for by French medical personnel, the two 'Native Brigades', about 2,600 in strength each, assisted decisively in the forest combat taking place in Acadia, Quebec and New England. The well-organized British army met the well-organized French army in combat, but was then attacked in the rear by native partisan fighters, giving the edge to the French forces battle after battle.\n\nThe natives and their territories subsequently fell into French colonial possession, both in Quebec to the north and in Louisiana to the south. Especially in Louisiana, the treatment of the natives was rough and completely unworthy of a people once allied with the Louisianan colonial government and its French mother country.\n\nThe bad treatment only changed with King Louis XVIII of France, who in 1853 designated the 'North American Compromise', effectively splitting the Louisiana territory in two, with the eastern area being reserved for white Frenchmen and the western territory being granted to the Native Americans, who, crossing state lines, formed the 'Council of the Peoples' to properly run their newly designated territory. The displacement enforced by the French colonists on the Natives was still equivalent to genocide in many places, including the home areas of tribes like the Algonquin, Lenape and Wabanaki who had once helped them in the combat against the British. But now, the Natives were just one French colonial governor away from freedom. In 1888, the increasingly urbanizing Native society, which had by then allowed white settlers to assimilate into their territories at small numbers, passed the 'Law of Freedom', which declared all power wielded by people not chosen by the population illegal. This piece of legislation, designed to form the Native Confederation, as it was now called, into a modern democratic nation state, was accepted by the French after a long and heated internal debate in Paris, even though the Natives in return had to agree to join the military alliance of France, the Entente, for 50 years. This treaty will expire in 1938. In 1938, the Natives will be truly free to choose their own destiny."

 HOL.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Netherlands"
 HOL.1.d:0 "The Netherlands had attempted to preserve its traditional role as a merchant state not involved in European land wars and instead opting for naval policy and conflict on the ocean - however, the ever-industrious Dutch were not quite crafty enough to escape the long reach of innumerable columns of French infantrymen. The Netherlands, intially having gained independence after the Eighty Years' War of 1568, had put their hopes in France's alliance with the Austrians, to whom the regions to the Netherlands' south belonged, would shield the Dutch from direct French invasion, but the Den Haag government had failed to anticipate France's attack upon Austrian territory in the Belgian War of 1791. France, after ending the campaign in an utter and overwhelming victory, then set its attention on its main goal: Making the Rhine river France's north-eastern border. One part of that was the 1806 Rhine Wars on German states like the Palatinate or the Bishopric of Cologne, but this policy also involved the French-Dutch War, the 'Great Humiliation', as it is sometimes called in the Netherlands. After a short and swift campaign, France faced a prolonged guerilla force of Dutch nationalists, but managed to eventually quell the rebellion in 1811. Even though there were the Dutch uprisings in 1831 and 1866 against French rule, the Netherlands was unable to reclaim the Dutch-speaking territories south of the Rhine since then, with the areas being incorporated into the French imperial regions of Brabant and Flanders.\n\nThe Netherlands has from that point on always viewed the reconquest of her lost territories as the ultimate and final goal of Dutch foreign policy, but the Netherlands was also forced to play nice with France - if just for the fear of being completely overrun and totally annexed by the far bigger, militarily far superior southern neighbor.\n\nThe Dutch were among the peoples who adopted the constitutional monarchism in the style of Louis XVIII, France's "reformer king". Since then, the monarchs of the Netherlands have taken a backseat to public policy, instead leaving their work to publically elected officials, with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking the prime position in government. Currently, the two main faces of Dutch politics are Queen Wilhelmina and Prime Minister Van Blokland, both of whom are known to be among the 'pragmatist' faction of policymaking, favoring peace and prosperity over a never-ending push to reclaim the southern provinces."

 OHI.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Ohio"
 OHI.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Ohio, which formally calls itself 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain, Ireland and America', is the last remnant of the United Kingdom. After the British monarch had fled into Prussian exile in 1813 because of the British Revolution, he was invited to France to discuss the restoration of his throne. The talks proved fruitless, as the French King made demands that a British Kingdom would drop any and all overseas claims - even including the Channel Islands, which would have gone to France. King George IV, after his father's abdication and dissolution of the throne the first "Grand Pretender", vehemently disagreed with this, insisting it would just cause another revolution. The French King was not willing to give up the trump card of a possible British restoration however and formally re-established the British monarchy - in Ohio, which he passed as a personal gift to the British King rather than an official transfer of territory between two nations. The state, which had formally marked the eastern border of Louisiana, had become the point of refuge for English-speaking American colonists who had been loyal to the crown during the American Revolution.\n\nOhio now finds itself trapped between Louisiana and the expansion-hungry United States, and King George V - who still calls himself 'King-Emperor of the British Empire in general and Ohio in particular' - is in increasingly bad health."

 PAP.1.d:0 "The popes of the Roman Catholic church managed to maintain their position of power in the heart of Italy mainly due to the diplomatic assistance of the catholic monarchs in Vienna and Paris. France, who had allowed Sardinia-Piedmont to unite the north in a bid to counteract Austrian aggression, had stopped the Sardinians from taking over the south of the peninsula due to concerns that a united Italian state would join the ranks of the great powers and would have the ability of turning on France in times of weakness or to even strike a deal with the Austrians to hand over the Veneto region peacefully.\n\nNow, the patriarch of christendom is threatened by an atheistic communist party that managed to take control in Italy's most recent elections, whereas the pope's southern neighbor, Naples, has fallen to the unpredictable fascistic movement of Achille Starace. Starace paints himself as a devout catholic and even enforced a compulsory religious law in Naples that forces every citizen to convert to Roman Catholicism, but his writings from the 1920s leave no doubt that he does not dream of a strong fascistic Naples, but instead a strong fascistic Italy - and the unification process he dreams of would without a doubt put him at odds with the papacy."

But maybe Russia's government instability shall prove the new Polish state's revival: After the third Bolshevik insurgency, in which Finnish and Polish rebels - even non-communists - played a vital role, Russia had been forced to sign into law the Poland-Finland Government Act, granting local autonomy to the two provinces and actually allowing them to form parliaments that, unlike the All-Russian Imperial Duma, are more than just meaningless show."

Ever since the 'Versagerkönig', the failed king, Frederick II has lead the nation into the Great War of 1756 against the far superior Franco-Austro-Russian coalition, Prussia's power was decisively weakened. Internally, Prussia went through several subsequent crises that resulted in the permanent establishment of a constitution in 1834 effectively resulting in the Hohenzollern monarchy becoming ceremonial.\n\nPrussia aimed in the past century to emulate France's success in order to be able to match her, but the fact that Prussia's alliance with Britain was not able to match the Franco-Austrian pact led to Germany permanently falling under French and Austrian, rather than Prussian, influence.\n\nPrussia has established a modern army, a colonial empire and a renovated liberalized society - but France has all of those things as well. Things are still looking up for Prussia recently, as Austria and Russia are increasingly threatened by ethnic minorities and the French are more concerned with the maintenance of their vast colonial empire rather than with containing Prussian influence.\n\nIn the meantime, the minor German states have scrambled all over the place: Radical leftists run Hannover, whereas the fascistic völkisch movement has taken control of Württemberg; Saxony and Bavaria are closely aligned with Austria politically and militarily, whereas Westphalia, Hesse and Baden have chosen French civil values. Thuringia sits in the center, choosing neutrality instead. These minors have various and diverse interests in each other, and peacefully convincing all of them will be just as impossible as conquering all of them by military means.

Vice-Admiral Raeder has reached out to the secretary with the following report:\n\n'Commodore at Sea Reinhard Heydrich, born March 7th in the year 1904, has repeatedly brought shame to the apolitical and proud navy of Prussia by promoting a vile fascistic ideology the likes of which even Alfred Rosenberg in Württemberg could not think of. Heydrich has openly advocated for racial profiling within the ranks of the navy, specifically calling for the dismissal of all Jewish naval officers from the force. This indecency in the navy cannot be tolerated any further. I have already informed Supreme Admiral Dönitz of my intentions to immediately and dishonorably discharge Heydrich from service and Dönitz had no objections. However, due to Heydrich's rank, I require the approval of the secretary of the navy to proceed. I hereby request that approval.\n\nsigned\nErich Raeder'\n\nHow should the secretary proceed?"

After the Autonomy Acts of 1906 and 1911, Quebec finally managed to gain French support for the Quebec Self-Determination Act of 1924, which was to go into effect on June 1st, 1926, the day that was since celebrated as Quebec's Day of Independence."

As Russia was struggling with the largest communist wave of aggression yet, the King of Romania was forced into exile and his prime minister executed. Bolshevik-aligned forces, the Romanian Red Guards, took Bucharest and, critically, the Ploesti oil fields, in a sweeping strike. The communists' biggest trump card turned out to be the Romanian ambassador in Paris though - a diplomat who turned out to be a secret admirer of the red guards. The ambassador swore allegiance to the new communist junta and then began contacting the French government in their name. The deal was simple: The Romanian communists - unlike the monarchists that preceded them - were willing to commit to long-term trade treaties regarding their oil fields if France in return was to guarantee Romanian independence from the Russians. The French government, anticipating a Bolshevik victory in Russia, accepted and ended up driving a wedge between itself and the eventually victorious tsarists. France has since tried to re-acquire distance from the Romanians, who seem themselves on the borders of three large reactionary empires.\nCan the revolution persist?"

Russia is an over-militarized giant, but is not able to use its massive army due to the great amount of opposition supporters throughout its soldiers and even officer corps. Russia puts faith in the idea that the size of the army alone will, combined with diplomatic sacrifice, be enough to maintain Russia's face abroad. This has so far worked out well enough, with the Russo-Japanese Crisis of 1900 being resolved by a territorial and financial exchange - but the world starts to sense Russia's weakness. The population is illiterate, and many of the more intellectual parts of it are actually members of ethnic minorities like the Estonians and the Latvians, who have now begun desiring their own states. Russia has made some attempts to decentralize the government peacefully, granting autonomy to the ethnic Poles and Finns of the empire within the possibilities of the concept of 'Divine Mandate'. But can that continue? Surely, giving autonomy to every single ethnic group will just result in the dissolution of the Russian Empire as a whole. Tsar Nicholas is without a direct male heir, the bolsheviks are out in force and the tsarist government has long lost the faith of the reform-minded democratic factions due to the emperor's failure to provide proper housing, healthcare and education to the millions of subjects living in his empire. Russia had to face civil war against its homegrown bolshevik population three times now, and the movement's leaders remain at large.

Stalin has begun advocating for a form of communism that is to embrace national identities and international borders not only in a short term, but permanently. This highly militaristic branch of bolshevik thought mixing communism with the Neapolitan branch of fascism has become known as 'National Bolshevism'.

The 'glorious revolution' of 1872 saw the fall of the Spanish monarchy and, subsequently, the end of Spanish rule in Latin America as the bourgeois peninsulares and criollos broke away, afraid of the communist revolution spreading into the colonies.\n\nThe colonial empire has been one of Spain's biggest ideological pains. Ever since Spain assisted France and Austria in the Great War of 1756, its colonial empire had grown, first with an increase in size at Portuguese expense in Africa. Since then, Spain has come close to overstretching her empire, losing control not only of the South American mainland, but also being forced to let Mexico and the Caribbean Confederation go before the intended flip of both places to communism could be realized. Since then, both of these countries have indeed adopted far-left theories of government, but they see themselves in a rivalry with Spain, having formed a 'Socialist Alliance' with the willful exclusion of Spain, mainly over the issue of Puerto Rico, the last Spanish colonial possession in the Americas as the Puerto Rican population had voluntarily chosen to remain Spanish when independence was granted to the Caribbean Confederation in 1888.\n\nSpain's struggles have not only been with her former colonial subjects. When Sweden invaded the island of Luzon in the Spanish Philippines in 1891, the French government forced Spain to hand the island over to the Swedes without conflict. Spain, struggling to keep up with the rest of the continent in terms of political and scientific progress, has since managed to form an alliance with the far-left government in northern Italy, but will this 'Barcelona Agreement' last considering the fact that  still has democratic elections and that the Italian Communist Party could already lose power as early June of 1938? Will it be enough to safeguard the revolution? Especially the overwhelming force on the Spanish border that is France has recently established relations with the moderate pro-democratic opposition movements. The French government, afraid of a possible fascist coup as well as a possible expansion of communist power, has debated a military intervention in Spain at least twice now, in 1921 and 1932.

The main war goal of the Swedish, the reclamation of Pomerania, had however been diplomatically blocked by Sweden's former allies, the French and the Russians. The Russians, not having forgotten the Great Northern War of 1700, had been opposed to Sweden being re-established as a European Great Power, hoping instead that Sweden's colonial empire would soon be overextended and Sweden be left with nothing. That plan did not work out for the Russians though, and Sweden, through clever diplomacy and opportune military campaigns at just the right moments, managed to steer the messy and foggy clouds that are European diplomacy. Sweden, recognizing France's sole position as world power, had soon after Louis XVIII's liberal reforms in the 1850s worked on decentralizing their own state in order to stay close to the French partner, joining the alliance compact that would later become known as the 'Entente' in 1868.\nSweden however overstretched her boundaries with the French with the Swedish-Spanish War of 1891. The conservative Swedish government had anticipated an easy diplomatic strike against communist Spain and even planned to annex large parts of the global Spanish empire, but to Sweden's surprise, France refused to join the military struggle. Paris did threaten intervention in order to force the Spanish government to the negotiation tables, but the French made sure that Sweden's gains would be minimal, only granting Luzon in the process. The Swedish government managed to paint France as the perpetrator of this disappointment of national enthusiasm (omitting the fact that France had also threatened war against Sweden should the Swedes refuse to take part in the negotiations), which turned Swedish popular opinion against France - and Norwegian popular opinion against Sweden. As Sweden left the Entente in 1893, so did Norway leave Sweden by peaceful referendum in 1894. While some Swedish policy makers had considered suppressing the Norwegian independence movement by force, Sweden had once again been faced with French military blackmail to let Norway go peacefully.\n\nSince the 1890s, Sweden attempted to keep a low profile.

 THR.1.d:0 "Thuringia is in the very heart of the German lands, surrounded by various hostile and friendly players on the German, European and global stages.\n\nInitially a rather small collection of rather small duchies, the French invasions of western Germany saw great militancy among the Thuringian feudal lords, with some choosing to side with the German defenders and some betraying their fellow countrymen and entering pacts and alliances with the French invader. Regent Lady Louise Elenore of Saxony-Meiningen, one of Thuringia's more notable states, allied the French in 1812, seizing an opportunity to invade Saxony-Coburg-Saalfeld and Saxony-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nAfter French victory, the Duchess-Regent, with support from French King Louis XVII, united the lands she conquered into the Grand Duchy of Thuringia (the French King would not have supported a "Kingdom" of Thuringia).\n\nSince then, Thuringia and France have grown distant. The next French monarch was the legendary "Reformer King" Louis XVIII, who resented both his father's reactionary policies and the states he propped up, including Thuringia. Subsequently, Georg II of Thuringia rekindled the relations with Prussia, coming to a border agreement with one Otto von Bismarck in 1869 and eventually gaining a Prussian guarantee of Thuringian independence, first by informal promise in 1872 and then on paper in 1881.\n\nThuringia's most recent major appearance on the world stage was the Hessian-Thuringian War of 1904, when the two minor German states went to war over a newly constructed Hessian border fortress armed with long-range heavy artillery powerful enough to strike the city of Eisenach in western Thuringia.\nThe war, although eventually a stalemate and with little casualties, caused France and Prussia to rethink their relationship after almost going to war to protect their respective German partners, with France backing Hesse and Prussia standing with Thuringia. France, Britain, Prussia and Austria would end up meeting for the 1906 Four Powers Conference in Berlin, where spheres of influence in western Europe were decided. Thuringia was placed firmly in the Prussian sphere, whereas its Saxon and Bavarian neighbors became Austria's domain and its old Hessian rival once again saw its French protection reaffirmed.\n\nThuringia used to have a amicable relation with Hannover to the north, but after a communist takeover in 1921, it seems unlikely that this old friendship will be of much help."

 TUR.1.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire"
 TUR.1.d:0 "Sometimes, a victorious coalition gets rid of its weakest link to have a new enemy to fight. The Ottoman Empire joined the Great War of 1756 at a rather late stage in order to gain diplomatic favors with the winning Franco-Austro-Russian coalition. Initially, the gamble seemed to pay off, with France being the first of the nations forging a new friendship with the sultan.\nHowever, France would also turn out to be the first nation betraying the Turkish people, with France supporting the independence of countries like Egypt, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and Romania in order to weaken the empire. The Russians were happy with this development, as it meant the Ottomans posed a little bit less of a threat to the Slavic peoples on the Balkan peninsula. With Russia and France again firmly in the camp of opposition, it would seem logical that the same was true for Turkey's nemesis of time immemorial, the Habsburg Empire - but paradoxically, the 1920s saw a flourishing relationship between Istanbul and Vienna. Austria and Turkey have common enemies, most importantly Russia and their Serbian allies - but France is currently drifting away from Austria just like it drifted away from the Ottomans decades ago.\n\nAustria and the Ottomans saw the disastrous Austro-Turkish War of 1881 between the two, in which the victorious Austrians forced the Turks to give up Montenegro, Serbia, Romania and parts of Greece. Although the hardliners have not forgiven the Austrians for this incursion, the pragmatists inside the Turkish government point to the future rather than the past, insisting that Austria is the only ally that in the current political climate would stay loyal to the Ottomans, as they don't have any interests in Ottoman territory. Russia meanwhile seeks to free the Armenians and French nationalists seek to secure the Suez Canal by annexing the Sinai peninsula and perhaps establishing a bridgehead in Lebanon. Austria meanwhile? They are too concerned with their own survival to have imperialistic ambitions against the Turks."

 TUR.4.d:0 "Although the Quran specifically makes clear that ethnicity should play not part in piety and religion, with all Muslims, be they Arabs and non-Arabs, being declared equally valuable in all aspects but in the strength of their faith, Turkish lawmakers have been scared of Syrian, Albanian and Palestinian priests taking up the role of clergy to then rally their faithful to the cause of independence - something that has provably happened at least twice before, when the Palestinians started a revolt against Ottoman rule in Tel Aviv in 1924 and then when Bulgarian Muslims joined their fellow Bulgarians of other faiths in demanding separation from the empire in 1928."

 USA.1.t:0 "The United States of America"
 USA.1.d:0 "Liberty. This one word sums up everything that American culture has traditionally stood for. Ever since the bloody Washington Uprising of 1782 and 1783, after which the unsuccessful rebellion leaders around George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were executed by British colonial police, America has sought nothing but freedom from colonial yoke.\nThe British Revolution of 1810 to 1813 was the opportunity that the young American nation used for its own revolution of 1811, and with dignity, fighting spirit and lots of French support, America finally broke free and was even recognized by the fletchling British Republic in 1815.\n\nBut since then, liberty has not been the solution to every problem. The United States, although decently industrialized, remains a regional player, especially due to the French-aligned states on her various borders. The United States has seen its share of nationalistic dreamers that want to expand into Florida or to even annex Louisiana. But are these dreamers truly showing the path of enlightenment? The current President, James Wadsworth, has promised prosperity and stability over silly diplomatic endeavours that might be the end of the republic. Wadsworth and his Republicans are firmly aligned with France, favoring a left-wing approach to government and the forming of an egalitarian welfare state following the French model. The main opposition party, the Democrats, are more in favor of a small government philosophy and advocate a concept of American isolationism and to get the U.S. out of France's sphere of influence. The Democrats have ties to dubious partners, including investors in Austria and Russia."

 WES.1.t:0 "The Republic of Westphalia"
 WES.1.d:0 "The various religious and feudal states of the region that nowadays make up Westphalia had proven too weak to stand up to French influence but also too reactionary to adopt meaningful and lasting reform. As the archbishopric of Cologne fell with French troops occupying the city in August of 1808, the power vacuum left by the catholic church losing its means to exercise control over its holdings was immense. Various Austrian-backed feudal lords as well the archbishop of Münster tried to pick up the pieces that the fall of Cologne had left, but the populations of the dukedoms of Cleves and Berg were fed up with both the old order and their own powerlessness to fix said order, beginning the Westphalian revolt. The ensuing civil war looked like a lost fight when in June of 1810 French 'volunteers' crossed the Rhine river and inflicted crushing defeat on Münster's troops at the Battle of Bad Honnef on October 26th, 1810. The 26th of October is celebrated to this day as a national holiday in Westphalia. Subsequently, the Westphalian Revolt changed to what became known as the Westphalian Wars, with France declaring simultaneous wars on the Duchy of Berg, the Duchy of Cleves, the Archbishopric of Münster and several free imperial cities like Dortmund and Düsseldorf. This French aggression was only lightly opposed by the Prussians and the Austrians, with Prussia's auxiliary force sent to aid Münster during the siege of the city, 7,800 Prussian soldiers in total, being completely destroyed by the French armies under the command of France's perhaps most prolific general at the time, Napoleon Bonaparte. In July of 1813, all of France's enemies in the region had been subjugated to the revolutionary movement by force, with said movement having given itself the title 'Westphalian and Rhenish Freedom League' in February of 1813. This Freedom League was allowed to form a state under French protection in December of the same year, was however forced to drop any references to the Rhineland - a French territory - from its name, resulting in the birth of the Republic of Westphalia.\n\nMore recently, Westphalia, still strongly aligned with France, has signed the Pact of Three Brothers, the Dreibrüderabkommen, with Baden and Hesse. All three German states are democratic and good friends and partners and also share the fact that France is their protector. However, many Westphalians still dream of uniting with their fellow Germans on the west side of the Rhine and of truly becoming the Republic of Westphalia and the Rhineland, as once anticipated - but can little Westphalia truly challenge mighty France?"

 WUR.1.t:0 "The Republic of Württemberg"
 WUR.1.d:0 "The downfall of the Württembergian democratic government in 1927 was caused by economic downturn. Austria attempted to diplomatically intervene and to reinstall the Württembergian monarchy in order to include Württemberg in the Danube Pact, but especially Prussian influence and the subsequent French neutrality allowed the Württembergian fascists to proceed. Prussia, more afraid of Austrian expansion than of Württembergian fascism, had since been Württemberg's most important foreign partner, but the Otto Wels administration had in 1935 retracted the formal Prussian guarantee of Württembergian independence.\n\nWürttemberg is lead by its Führer, Alfred Rosenberg. Rosenberg has become the leading figure of the völkisch movement throughout Germany and seeks an eventual unification of all German-speaking peoples (with the exception of the German Jews) into a single state. Württemberg is however diplomatically isolated, surrounded by the French sphere of influence to the west, the Prussian sphere of influence to the north and the Austrian sphere of influence to the east. Württemberg's only 'friend' is the Neapolitan state in southern Italy, and it seems unlikely that Starace's fascists would be of great assistance in any Württembergian conflict."

 WUR.2.d:0 "The Württembergian government has made it a regular practice to invite members of the völkisch movement from other parts of Germany to show the strength and connectedness of German fascism.\n\nSuch a visit has now been concluded, after Adolf Hitler, second-in-command in the völkisch-minded Bavarian Workers' Party, visited Stuttgart with his personal entourage, the "Hitlergarde". Hitler held a much-appraised speech over a partial unification plan in which Bavaria and Württemberg could form the core of a southern German awakening of all-German fascism. Hitler warned that only catholicism had the religious and ideological strength to carry a fascistic movement and advocated that the capital of a united Germany should not be in Prusso-protestant Berlin, but rather in a catholic bastion like Cologne or Munich.\n\nWhile he amazed the Württembergian masses during his speech, Hitler made it clear during his conversations behind the scenes that Rosenberg's position as German leader was far from uncontroversial in his home state and that the fear of Württembergian leadership was the main reason keeping everyday Bavarian citizens from joining the movement. Hitler advised that a more publically popular and charismatic candidate should be found and that Rosenberg should take a high-ranking administrative position instead. The Führer, while outraged at Hitler's words, still made sure to maintain the public facade of Bavarian-Württembergian fascistic brotherhood."

 WUR.3.d:0 "The (in-)famous "Zentrum für Rassenwissenschaften", ZfRW for short, the center for racial sciences, has once more opened its doors in Stuttgart, Württemberg's capital. The center consists of a public part, which is mainly a museum concerned with the obvious biological inferiority of Jews and Africans paired with a bookstore selling Rosenberg's bibliography, and a private institution teaching and researching biology with a focus on anthropology and racial differences in humans in particular. The center had been forced to close its doors in early 1935 after a part of the ceiling collapsed - the architect of the building was promptly accused of being a Jewish Bolshevik and executed by firing squad.\n\nOne new feature of the renovated center is that the museum tours, books and even parts of the curriculum are now not only offered in German, but also are completely available in French and Italian and partially available in English, Japanese, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. This multilingual endeavor is meant to attract more international tourists, especially from countries that are already fascist like the Andean Republic or Naples or countries with large fascist underground movements like France and Britain."

 WUR.4.d:0 "In a rather embarassing chain of events, it appears that German-language newspapers in Hesse, Baden and Bavaria all report about a large number of cases of sodomy in the armed forces. These newspapers have found their way into the country shortly after Hitler's visit from Bavaria - almost as if he had them distributed to undermine Rosenberg's regime. However they got into the country, they are now everywhere and it appears that freshly printed ones are smuggled across the unguarded parts of our borders and delivered by subversive liberal forces straight to the home of law-abiding citizens to shatter their belief in our glorious army.\n\nIn front of a committee set up to investigate this unhumane behavior, commander Erwin Rommel reported that sodomy was a very rare occurence in the army and that dealing with this almost non-existant problem would blow it out of proportion, further sensationalizing the issue. Wilhelm List added, as recorded by the stenographer: "Our barracks are full of horny youngsters with their ((long pause)) sausages. Sometimes things get out of hand, but our officers ((short pause)) usually see to discrete ((long pause)) punishment."\n\nWhile our political elite is outraged, there seems to be not much we can do.

 WUR.5.d:0 "As part of our government-sponsored campaign for international speakers at the Center for Racial Sciences in Stuttgart, French fascistic leader Pierre-Etienne Flandin has taken the time to travel to Stuttgart to hold speeches in two separate events to the students and staff. Flandin, who speaks fluent German, contributed to both the French- and the German-language curricula and has examined the various differences and similarities between the German and French fascistic movements.\n\nWhereas the French fascists are monarchists, the Germans are generally republican. Where the French tie their national identity strongly to the catholic faith, the German movement is almost irreligious due to the diversity of Christian denominations present throughout the various German realms. Where the Germans have mixed messaging regarding their economic policies, the French have clearly adopted a model of "national socialism", combining leftist economic ideas with far-right nationalism - a model that some politicians like Goebbels in Westphalia or Draxler and Hitler in Bavaria have in the past applauded, whereas Rosenberg has called for caution to not offend the powerful financial forces of the various German states.\n\nFlandin saw the main similarity between German and French fascists in their immense territoriality, but he ended on a relative high note - that French fascists could accept a unified and fascistic Germany - as long as that unified Germany stayed east of the Rhine. Under the ensuing boos of the German listeners, he warned that "Fascism is not an ideology that makes allies of various fascists. Communists think in global terms, fascists think in national terms. If German fascism threatens France, then French fascism will be glad to destroy your litte wet dreams of a Führerstaat."\n\nA mixed bag of a speech, to be honest."
