 JAP_reform_the_economy:0 "Reform the Economy"
 JAP_reform_the_economy_desc:0 "The Japanese economy is stagnant due to a lack of both exports and imports. Manufacturing jobs are leaving the country towards more profitable shores like California, Quebec or the colonial possessions of European powers in South Asia. Japan needs to stay competitive within the global economy."
 JAP_japanese_railways:0 "Japanese Railways"
 JAP_japanese_railways_desc:0 "The Japanese islands are vaster and especially more hilly and mountainous than one might expect. Japanese capitalists have so far avoided build rail lines through the hard of Honshu island, choosing instead to build cheaper infrastructure in the coastal areas. That policy needs to be amended by government intervention."
 JAP_expand_the_automotive_industry:0 "Expand the Automotive Industry"
 JAP_expand_the_automotive_industry_desc:0 "Cars, trucks and tractors are among Japan's most important export goods. Both Europeans and Asians abroad crave cars built by experts like Mitsubishi, Toyota and Mazda - we should send additional funds and tax cuts their way in order to both boost exports and perhaps improve the motorized wing of our armed forces as well."
 JAP_korean_and_manchurian_railways:0 "Korean and Manchurian Railways"
 JAP_korean_and_manchurian_railways_desc:0 "China is expanding its rail system on our border in order to prepare a possible invasion of Manchuria to reclaim the territory we gained in the Second Sino-Japanese War. We have to counteract the Chinese expansion with our own so that we can make sure our troops stay dynamic and combat-ready."
 JAP_invest_in_the_zaibatsus:0 "Invest in the Zaibatsus"
 JAP_invest_in_the_zaibatsus_desc:0 "Zaibatsu ('financial clique') is the Japanese term for the big financial and industrial companies of the empire. The 'big four', Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Yasuda, hold massive amounts of influence in the Japanese government - it is only fitting that the government should also hold influence in the leadership of these companies."
 JAP_expand_tokyo_university:0 "Expand Tokyo University"
 JAP_expand_tokyo_university_desc:0 "The Japanese education system has been severely hit by the 1929 Education Decrees, in which most subjects apart from agriculture, economy and military studies saw their government subsidies taken away. Physics, biology, mathematics, engineering, medicine and other schools of study are lacking behind the rest of the world already, just seven years later. We need to bring back these subsidies."
 JAP_the_future_of_the_showa_period:0 "The Future of the Shōwa Period"
 JAP_the_future_of_the_showa_period_desc:0 "Emperor Hirohito took the throne from his father in 1926. He put his reign under the name 'Shōwa', 'enlightened peace'. Can the enlightenment of the peace last? Where will the government go? Should the emperor not own up at last to the fact that a fascistic military clique has increasingly taken control from him?"
 JAP_publish_the_humanity_declaration:0 "Publish the Humanity Declaration"
 JAP_publish_the_humanity_declaration_desc:0 "Hirohito is the 124th Emperor, but all of them have in common that it is implied or even outright said that they are (or were) living gods. Hirohito should publish a decree that clarifies that emperors are in fact human and that their rule is not based upon the Shinto gods but rather the Japanese people."
 JAP_empower_the_hardliners:0 "Empower the Hardliners"
 JAP_empower_the_hardliners_desc:0 "We cannot afford to question the doctrine of imperial divinity. Should the emperor put his own existance as a God into question, we would soon have to also revoke the government doctrine of the Japanese being chosen by the divine beings, thus losing the basis upon which the coordinated discrimination of the Chinese and Korean people stand. We cannot let that happen."
 JAP_liberalize_the_government:0 "Liberalize the Government"
 JAP_liberalize_the_government_desc:0 "The Emperor needs to henceforth have a more watchful eye on the politicians and see to it that the fascistic reforms of the early years of his reign are revoked. The re-introduction of a general election system is long overdue; it is clearly that the elitist fascistic cliques have failed to steer Japan towards glory."
 JAP_reaffirm_racial_theories:0 "Reaffirm Racial Theories"
 JAP_reaffirm_racial_theories_desc:0 "In two pieces of legislation in 1907 and 1928 respectively, the Japanese government wrote it into law that only ethnically Japanese people, born with at least three ethnically Japanese grandparents, enjoy full civil rights, whereas the non-Japanese are subject to additional taxation, more oppressive conscription standards and exempt from the right to education. This stance needs to be confirmed once more."
 JAP_make_tojo_prime_minister:0 "Make Tojo Prime Minister"
 JAP_make_tojo_prime_minister_desc:0 "The Emperor is too busy with his hobby of being a god to truly have time to run Japanese society. So far, he has nominated rather weak prime ministers, but that is to change now. Hideki Tojo, former minister of the interior, mastermind of the 1928 Supremacy Decree and the 1929 Education Decree, will make an excellent choice to lead Japan into greatness."
 JAP_cabinet_reform:0 "Cabinet Reform"
 JAP_cabinet_reform_desc:0 "The Japanese government has only relied on five central positions: The Prime Minister, the minister for the interior, the foreign minister, the chancellor of the treasury and the minister of defense. We need to enact a policy more in line with the French or Prussian cabinet, where there are dozens of ministerial positions for more specialized tasks of government."

 JAP_assassinate_the_chinese_leader_desc:0 "WIP"
 JAP_secure_the_manchurian_borderlands:0 "Secure the Manchurian Borderlands"
 JAP_secure_the_manchurian_borderlands_desc:0 "It has long been suspected that the Second Sino-Japanese War, although successful, might have overstretched Japan's resources and logistical abilities. Hu Hanmin's Chinese fascists are currently clearly superior in terms of military strength on the mainland and Japan needs to secure its Manchurian possessions in order to not just lose them a mere decade after their acquisition."
 JAP_expand_japanese_naval_bases:0 "Expand Japanese Naval Bases"
 JAP_expand_japanese_naval_bases_desc:0 "The Japanese Navy has a secret plan called 'Operation Final Struggle', in which the Japanese Navy would react to a Chinese military victory in Manchuria and Korea by primarily keeping the Japanese islands safe and to then oversee a naval invasion of the Korean and Chinese east coasts. To make Final Struggle possible, the navy has requested additional naval bases at home."
 JAP_military_industrialism:0 "Military Industrialism"
 JAP_military_industrialism_desc:0 "WIP"
 JAP_expand_the_army:0 "Expand the Army"
 JAP_expand_the_army_desc:0 "The Japanese land forces have been neglected in the early 1930s due to the false hope put in the 'military overview paper' of 1927, in which general Akira Mutō made the assumption that Hanmin's China would not be in fighting shape until 1945. Now it is 1936, and China is very much in fighting shape - our army expansion needs to be significantly accelerated."
 JAP_expand_mainland_naval_bases:0 "Expand Mainland Naval Bases"
 JAP_expand_mainland_naval_bases_desc:0 "Korea and Manchuria need to be included in our naval planning in order to assure the supply of our land forces. Furthermore, a new line of naval bases would enable us to position our battlefleets closer to the Chinese coast in order to contain Hanmin's imperialistic ambition against our homeland."
 JAP_conduct_artillery_tests:0 "Conduct Artillery Tests"
 JAP_conduct_artillery_tests_desc:0 "Artillery has to be the backbone of the modern land force, even moreso than the armored vehicles like tanks. Artillery is relatively mobile, versatile and, most importantly, cheap and easy to produce. Forward, artillery!"
 JAP_create_an_independent_air_force:0 "Create an Independent Air Force"
 JAP_create_an_independent_air_force_desc:0 "In the army law of 1917, it was determined that all planes are part of the army branch of the Japanese armed forces. Later, in 1924, that was amended to exclude planes serving on carriers and on coastal patrol services that were reassigned to the navy. It is clear that the current policy regarding aircraft is inefficient. We need a Japanese air force to serve as the third branch of the military."
 JAP_massive_warships:0 "Massive Warships"
 JAP_massive_warships_desc:0 "Of the major navies, most are forced to make a choice between pursuing either a carrier-focussed or a battleship-focussed naval force. The French have recently attempted to go for the 'Naval Hybrid Approach', something that seems to have been working rather well for them. Emulating the French model, Japan should seek to develop advanced battleships and aircraft carriers at the same time."
 JAP_develop_tank_forces:0 "Develop Tank Forces"
 JAP_develop_tank_forces_desc:0 "After assuring the quality of our artillery pieces, we can now move forward to the things that are to move the army forward: Tanks. Although we will produce them is significantly lower numbers than we will artillery pieces, we need to develop new doctrines in the style of the Prussian general Heinz Guderian in order to have our army succeed in the field."
 JAP_airfields_in_manchuria:0 "Airfields in Manchuria"
 JAP_airfields_in_manchuria_desc:0 "Our air force needs space to operate, especially close to the frontline against China. Constructing additional airfields in Manchuria is without alternative."
 JAP_develop_tactical_bombers:0 "Develop Tactical Bombers"
 JAP_develop_tactical_bombers_desc:0 "Operating close to the frontline and in coordination with the troops, tactical bombers are designed mainly to attack static defenses or high-priority large targets like enemy warships or tanks. They can also double as direct attackers against the enemy economy and infrastructure, making them doubly effective."
 JAP_focus_on_tanks:0 "Focus on Tanks"
 JAP_focus_on_tanks_desc:0 "It has become clear that the war of movement is the way to go for the Japanese military. By developing new and improved models of armored fighting vehicles and by developing Guderian-style Blitzkrieg tactics, Japan will be a fast-moving menace on the battlefield."
 JAP_focus_on_artillery:0 "Focus on Artillery"
 JAP_focus_on_artillery_desc:0 "Tanks are expensive to construct and easy targets for the enemy. The Japanese armed forces cannot afford such expensive weaponry and should rather focus on developing 'Superior Firepower'-style tactics in the image of Californian commander MacArthur or Prussian commander Manstein."
 JAP_develop_strategic_bombers:0 "Develop Strategic Bombers"
 JAP_develop_strategic_bombers_desc:0 "The Strategic Bomber is the Tactical Bomber's bigger, stronger and grumpier brother. Designed almost exclusively for warfare against the enemy civilian population and for bombing missions against enemy urban centers to assure economic and psychological destruction alike, the Strategic Bombing Force has so far only been a theory across the world. Japan could be onto something revolutionary here."
 JAP_bushido:0 "Bushido"
 JAP_bushido_desc:0 "After picking our land doctrine, we need to now drive forward in pursuing it and need to determine the Bushido, the way of the warrior, for our troops."
 JAP_develop_fighter_planes:0 "Develop Fighter Planes"
 JAP_develop_fighter_planes_desc:0 "Japan's fighters need to be cost-efficient, easy to construct and maneuverable. Developing prototypes like the Mitsubishi Zero to completion will go a long way in assuring Japanese dominance over both China and the Pacific Ocean."
 JAP_revoke_the_1929_education_decrees:0 "Revoke the 1929 Education Decrees"
 JAP_revoke_the_1929_education_decrees_desc:0 "Interior Minister Tojo oversaw in 1929 a series of legislative changes that collectively have become known as the 'Education Decrees of 1929' or the 'Common Sense Decrees' according to the fascists. The central one of these laws, the 'Japanese Educational Supremacy Act', has forbidden Korean and Manchurian citizens from visiting university - a great loss of potential that we need to revert."
 JAP_anti_communism:0 "Anti-Communism"
 JAP_anti_communism_desc:0 "Although the country has decisively moved away from far-right policies, that does not mean letting the far-left gain a hold on the country. The Japanese Communist Party still cannot be allowed to operate and needs to be persecuted."
 JAP_anti_fascism:0 "Anti-Fascism"
 JAP_anti_fascism_desc:0 "We have to leave our past behind us. Declaring the continued support of 'Tojoism', as it henceforth will be called, to be an illegal act will help us enforcing our government agenda on the population. Furthermore, we consider that Hideki Tojo must be executed."
 JAP_take_mongolia:0 "Take Mongolia"
 JAP_take_mongolia_desc:0 "Communist Mongolia is rumored to be a power base for both the Chinese and the Japanese communists and even the Manchurian and Korean independence movements. It is time to stop these reds."
 JAP_endorse_the_kuomintang:0 "Endorse the Kuomintang"
 JAP_endorse_the_kuomintang_desc:0 "A direct attack upon China would be foolish. We should see to it that the Kuomintang are put back in power in order to secure our gains - and the transition of power should preferably be a long, drawn-out, bloody civil war."
 JAP_mainland_universities:0 "Mainland Universities"
 JAP_mainland_universities_desc:0 "Establishing universities in cities like Seoul and Pyongyang will enable us to more efficiently find the very talented among our colonial peoples."
 JAP_provoke_the_chinese_civil_war:0 "Provoke the Chinese Civil War"
 JAP_provoke_the_chinese_civil_war_desc:0 "The Kuomintang are in a position to strike - it is time to unleash a civil war in China and to see the SSM of Hu Hanmin removed from power."
 JAP_third_sino_japanese_war:0 "Third Sino-Japanese War"
 JAP_third_sino_japanese_war_desc:0 "It is at last time to eliminate the Chinese threat on our border. We defeated them in 1897 and we defeated them again in 1925 - we shall do it again now."
 JAP_attack_shandong:0 "Attack Shandong"
 JAP_attack_shandong_desc:0 "The Shandong Qlique, propped up by Prussia, is a result of western imperialism and needs to be eradicated. Berlin might object, but the Germans cannot stand up to the might of the Japanese - what are they gonna do, sail over here with their four warships? Laughable."
 JAP_attack_the_southern_clique:0 "Attack the Southern Clique"
 JAP_attack_the_southern_clique_desc:0 "The Southern Clique is a result of the French, Spanish and Swedish meddling on the Chinese coast. While we are not willing to go after these European empires themselves yet, their little puppet states in China give them legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese population - legitimacy that rightfully belongs to us. The Southern Clique needs to perish."
 JAP_attack_yunnan:0 "Attack Yunnan"
 JAP_attack_yunnan_desc:0 "One of the last remaining medieval-style feudal states on earth, the secluded Yunnan Clique of south-eastern China and northern Burma is the world's anus: It stinks, it's uncivilized and its color of choice is brown. Perhaps, Yunnan's time has come to an end."
