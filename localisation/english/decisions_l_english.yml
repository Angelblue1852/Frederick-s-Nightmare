 ITA_allow_political_commissars_at_the_convention_desc:0 "It has been brought to Prime Minister Togliatti's attention that the 20 members of the Popular Vanguard Committee which oversees the party's political commissars in the countryside could be through a loophole included as voting members of the commission. The Popular Vanguard Committee is fiercely loyal to the Prime Minister's Moderati faction and could decisively swing the convention in their favor."
 ITA_anti_staracist_razzias:0 "Anti-Staracist Razzias"
 ITA_anti_staracist_razzias_desc:0 "Because of how deeply interwoven Italian politics is even across the otherwise hostile international border lines, it would be comparatively easy to exclude delegates from the convention by throwing them in prison, thus reducing the overall number of delegates required for a majority. By targeting politicians with ties speficially to Neapolitan Staracists, it would be doable to quickly eliminate Bolscevichi delegates, as the movement is deeply connected to the southern fascists."
 ITA_distribute_stalinist_pamphlets:0 "Distribute Stalinist Pamphlets"
 ITA_distribute_stalinist_pamphlets_desc:0 "For perspective, it is always helpful to offer foreign viewpoints as external references for delegates to make up their minds. By specifically distributing the writings of Joseph Stalin, the internationalists might get friendlier to the Bolscevichi standpoints - but if the Tsar catches wind of this, Russia will be most displeased."
 ITA_hispanophile_propaganda:0 "Hispanophile Propaganda"
 ITA_hispanophile_propaganda_desc:0 "Both the Moderati and particularly the Bolscevichi are skeptical of Italy's alliance with Spain.\n\nThe Bolscevichi dislike the Spanish on the basis of pan-nationalistic sentiment and particularly the question of the Balearic Islands. On the ohter hand, the Moderati are mistrusting of Spain's totalitarian form of government and view the Barcelona Agreement as a total pact of convenience.\n\nIt will be difficult to find a narrative that both emphasizes cultural importances of a Spanish-Italian friendship to the Bolscevichi while also reassuring the Moderati of Spain's ideological acceptability as an ally. But if such a narrative could be found, Globalisti and Protettori could make great profits."

 ITA_host_scientific_caucus_events_desc:0 "The Scientific Caucus is a political organ of the PCI that, while not itself a voting member of the Bologna Convention, is strongly associated with the Moderati. While the Bolscevichi will be likely unimpressed by intellectual gibberish, the Globalisti and Protettori might just be swayed to adopt more plebiscitarian and pro-democratic views."
 ITA_introduce_abelism:0 "Introduce Abelism"
 ITA_introduce_abelism_desc:0 "Hannoverian communism is a somewhat recent addition to the spectrum of the international and one that in its realpolitik is not really understood very well.\nHannover has had to make tough choices between nationalism and internationalism, choices between war and peace, choices between diplomacy and isolation to traverse the muddy multi-ideological political landscape of the German realm - choices that could be reminiscient of Italy's own position in comparison to Naples and the Papal State. Holding an event about Karl Abel's school of communism could be an opportunity to bring all four factions a bit closer together."
 ITA_invite_national_socialists:0 "Invite Nationalistic Socialists"
 ITA_invite_national_socialists_desc:0 "Benito Mussolini's Bolscevichi have long complained that Italian socialism is too international in its approach and has lobbied to expand the convention with some 'nationalistic socialists', a phrase that sounds suspiciously similar to Alfred Rosenberg's 'national socialism' in Württemberg or Antonio Mosconi's idea of 'nazionalsocialismo' in the Neapolitan ministry of finance.\n\nGroups that Mussolini would like to invite to the convention include the 'Sicilian socialists in exile', the 'Central Italian socialist government-in-exile' and the 'national syndicalists of Bologna'. All three of these organizations are suspected by the Italian secret service to be espionage tools of the Neapolitan government."
 ITA_invite_spanish_guest_speakers:0 "Invite Spanish Guest Speakers"

 ITA_radicalization_efforts_desc:0 "Togliatti's Moderati are the largest and most overextended faction. By making a specific effort to sabotage their unity, less loyal delegates could be easily pushed to abandon the Prime Minister in favor of one of his rivals.\nHowever, it would not be possible to guide such propaganda as to conceal the true intentions behind the political sabotage. It could be possible that such an act ends up shifting power from the Moderati to yet another hostile faction."
 ITA_spread_antisemitic_conspiracy_theories:0 "Spread antisemitic Conspiracy Theories"
 ITA_spread_antisemitic_conspiracy_theories_desc:0 "It is usually hard to convince internationalists of committing themselves to ethnoreligious prejudice, but if Mussolini's anti-Jewish messaging were to be disguised as criticisms of vague concepts of evil international financiers, his supporters could find excuses for how he sells the exact same messages as Alfred Rosenberg in Germany."

The governments of Serbia and Montenegro have positioned themselves against such a proposal, partially because of the ideological differences between the two, but primarily because such a state should in both countries' opinion not come about until Slovenians, Croatians and Bosnians were allowed to choose whether or not to take part in such an endeavor."
