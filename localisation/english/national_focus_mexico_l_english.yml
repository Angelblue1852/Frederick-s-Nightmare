 MEX_create_the_ctm_desc:0 "Communism functions only if workers' concerns are heard and if their rights are respected. It is absolutely integral to our ideology and to the moral high ground that we try to elevate ourselves onto in regards to other communist movements that our workers are happy and well-fed. The unions in our country should be reformed a centralized federation, the "Confederación de Trabajadores de México", or CTM for short."

 MEX_reinforce_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "The main reason why the Barcelona Agreement and the Socialist Alliance are separate entities was the unwillingness of Mexico and the Caribbean Confederation to accept Spain's ongoing occupation of faraway colonial territories. M. N. Roy once called Spain "moderately capitalist" rather than communist, a view that was reinforced when Spain allied with another "communist" colonial empire, Italy."

This has annoyed the English-speaking minority in the far north, especially Texas. Magón's laws will be reverted: English must be allowed to exist alongside Spanish."
