 CHI_replace_the_rifles_desc:0 "Chinese infantry weaponry is extremely outdated, one of the main reasons why the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1925 ended in utter defeat for Beijing. This deficit needs to be compensated."
 CHI_artillery_innovations:0 "Artillery Innovations"
 CHI_artillery_innovations_desc:0 "The Japanese victory in the two wars between Japan and China was in large parts caused by the superior quality and the more sophisticated application of Japanese weapon systems. Before even trying to catch up to Japan on the scientific front however, the Chinese land forces will need a solid backbone to fall back on - and that backbone must be a strong and dynamic artillery force."
 CHI_vehicular_combat:0 "Vehicular Combat"
 CHI_vehicular_combat_desc:0 "Following China's recent advances in artillery, the government must now go on to bring about the 'fuel revolution' in the Chinese armed forces. The concept of such a fuel revolution, first presented by Prussian army commander Mackensen in 1921, is the idea of replacing the infantryman's need to walk on foot to the battlefield by introducing great numbers of trucks supported by tanks."

 CHI_reaffirm_the_security_decree_desc:0 "The 1934 Security Decree essentially banned all political parties in China - except for the Self-Strengthening Movement. Reinforcing the fascistic elites is what China needs to grow."

 CHI_found_military_academies_desc:0 "Hessian military historian Gerhard G. B. Ritter analyzed the Chinese defeat to Japan in 1920s to not only be caused by equipment shortcomings, but also by lackluster doctrine and especially by badly trained officers. China must face the reality that its officer class is without class - and that needs to change."

 CHI_exclusive_imperialism:0 "Exclusive Imperialism"
 CHI_exclusive_imperialism_desc:0 "A concept developed by Hu Hanmin in a memorandum in 1931, Exclusive Imperialism describes the concept of anti-imperialist imperialism. China is to fend off western influence in East Asia by establishing an empire of its own and by regaining its national pride and all its lost territories. The westerners can continue to play empire - but they need to get off our lawn."

 CHI_supremacy_over_islam_desc:0 "Islamic influence in China began when Caliph Uthman began sending envoys to Emperor Gaozong in 650 AD, but it would take until the conversion of the Central Asian Turkic peoples, including the Uighurs of Sinkiang, that the religion was taking shape on Chinese soil. Hu Hanmin has long declared Confucian radicalism, especially the "obedience to hierarchy" part, China's only religious maxime. Islam will submit."

 CHI_avenge_the_humiliation_desc:0 "The two Sino-Japanese Wars are all to well in Chinese memory. It is at last time to settle the score - third time's the charm, as the westerners say. Japan must be driven out of Manchuria and Korea, and the Japanese government needs to fall back into vassalship to the glorious China."

 CHI_alliance_with_the_maoists_desc:0 "Mao Zedong is a national bolshevik who has expressed sympathies for the Self-Strengthening Movement and has subsequently been expelled from the Chinese Communist Party. He is currently sitting in Chongqing Province Prison - but he is willing to strike a deal with the "hated fascists". If we secure him a position of power, he is willing to be our little communist lapdog."

 CHI_the_great_leap_forward:0 "The Great Leap Forward"
 CHI_the_great_leap_forward_desc:0 "Trying to force the issue of China's economic rejuvenation has to take the communist-friendly government's top priority. Communist attachés from Spain, Mexico and Italy have suggested to us a (potentially reckless) no-look-back policy on bringing about economic growth.
