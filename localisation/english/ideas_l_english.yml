 #GOVERNMENT DOCTRINE
 protectionism:0 "Protectionism"
 protectionism_desc:0 "Protectionists are primarily concerned with keeping homegrown goods at home and protecting employees at home. This autarky is good for self-reliance in times of crisis, but yields reduced results in times of intercontinental prosperity."
 dynamic_trade:0 "Dynamic Trade"
 dynamic_trade_desc:0 "Always spiralling somewhere between universal free trade and unhinged trade wars, dynamic traders are the jacks-of-all-trades of international policy. changing their tariff laws and shipping regulations whenever public opinion or the possibility of short-term gain entice them to. That makes them harder to trust, but gives them more options."
 libertarian_trade:0 "Libertarian Trade"
 libertarian_trade_desc:0 "Believing that borders are in their best state when trucks can pass each other at high speeds in either direction, mercantile libertarians are obsessed with the potential for profit derived from international free trade areas. They seek to eliminate tariffs entirely."
 laissez_faire:0 "Laissez Faire"
 laissez_faire_desc:0 "Derived from a French phrase meaning "let do", Laissez Faire economists believe in a handsoff approach to government in the free market."
 economic_intervention:0 "Economic Intervention"
 economic_intervention_desc:0 "While supporting capitalistic free trade for the most part, economic interventionists are not afraid to pump up certain industries with government funding when it is needed to save jobs and to garner votes or popular opinion."
 state_capitalism:0 "State Capitalism"
 state_capitalism_desc:0 "In state capitalism, the government takes a central part in most major business decisions throughout the country. This can take the shape of business oversight committees or just flatout government ownership of most companies. Generally though, the economy still runs under the logic of profitability, setting state capitalism apart from the planned economy."
 planned_economy:0 "Planned Economy"
 planned_economy_desc:0 "Whereas other forms of capitalism look at the very recent past to make immediate business decisions, planned economies instead choose to take a more long-term view, elevating multi-year plans and assigning resources before they are produced. This system is less dynamic and far more static than the rapid-fire capitalistic systems it competes with, but it allows the government total and unchecked control over the marketplaces."
 atheism:0 "Atheism"
 atheism_desc:0 "Under atheism, any and all religious beliefs are rejected if not persecuted. Religion is avoided in schools and churches are often taxed like they are private businesses."
 secularism:0 "Secularism"
 secularism_desc:0 "Secularism recognizes the existance and value of the church, but denies it access to government or the lawmaking process. Nevertheless, churches are often exempt from regulations and taxation to put less of a strain on the faithful."
 pluralism:0 "Pluralism"
 pluralism_desc:0 "The state is religious and funds religious institutions, but does not oppress minority religions, even allowing them to prosper and flourish."
 moralism:0 "Moralism"
 moralism_desc:0 "Moralistic states have a state religion that is enforced by law and that is propagated in school as absolute truths. Opposing faiths as well as irreligious beliefs are ignored or even persecuted."
 jingoism:0 "Jingoism"
 jingoism_desc:0 "Jingoism connects darwinism and machiavellianism with foreign policy. Jingoistic societies believe in war as a holy part of the social order and are willing to go to war more easily than others. However, jingoistic societies are often very skeptical of assisting other nations and will often oppose volunteer or expeditionary units fighting under foreign flags."
 assertiveness:0 "Assertiveness"
 assertiveness_desc:0 "While not as obsessed with immediate and maximized territorial expansion like the jingos are, proponents of assertiveness believe in spheres of influence and in a power structure that must be turned in the favor of the fatherland. They will provide great support to defensive efforts for the sake of allied nations and cheer on volunteers that take up the issue of other peoples struggling alongside their own."
 diplomatic_solidarity:0 "Diplomatic Solidarity"
 diplomatic_solidarity_desc:0 "War is the last resort to the proponents of diplomatic solidarity. They seek to join and expand ideologically aligned international alliances and will also support volunteer efforts for the sake of allied or similar-minded nations, but they will be skeptical of any war effort started by their own nation."
 pacifism:0 "Pacifism"
 pacifism_desc:0 "Pacifists don't believe in the absence of the military, but they reject war as well as foreign involvement in most if not all capacities. Pacifists favor international neutrality and a strong defensive force at home."

 agricultural_barons:0 "Agricultural Barons"
 agricultural_barons_desc:0 "Agricultural Barons, sometimes called Agri-Barons for short, are rich land owners on the countryside, typically male and part of the dominant ethnic group, that employ large numbers of people in the agricultural sectors.\n\nAgricultural Barons tend to be opposed to most of the social welfare state, especially education programs that would threaten their cheap labor workforce, and they generally support an ideologically reactionary, pro-capitalistic government with at most limited influence. Between non-reactionary factions, they despise communists and radical socialists the most, as these political movements actively threaten the economic and social existance of the Agricultural Barons."
 air_force_officers:0 "Air Force Officers"
 air_force_officers_desc:0 "It is rare for military officers that are specifically part of the Air Force to gain influence in a country, but when they do, they turn out to be typically more technocratic and less socially conservative than their army and navy counterparts. The existance of the air force depends on rapid technological progress and its power within society is reliant on the government's willingness to take risks when pursuing economic and military goals. Air Force Officers are especially interested in helping nominally civilian projects to build more commercial airports, as such landing strips could be transformed into military airfields in cases of war."

 aristocratic_elites:0 "Aristocratic Elites"
 aristocratic_elites_desc:0 "Sometimes referred to simply as 'the upper class', Aristocratic Elites are staunch supporters of the political and financial status quo - as the status quo is what allowed them to strive and to become wealthy. The elites tend to tread carefully when it comes to economic reform, while being more accepting of social changes as long as these changes don't threaten their social privileges.\n\nAristocrats are especially fond of limited authoritarian rule, as that is the ideology most supportive of the social and economic status quo. While the elites are wary of the pluralism of democracy as well as the totalitarianism of fascist rule, they absolutely despise communists as well as far-left democrats in favor of major campaigns of redistributing economic wealth. The aristocratic elites will fund smear campaigns and even support paramilitary forces that are opposed to communists, bolsheviks and radical socialists."
 army_officers:0 "Army Officers"
 army_officers_desc:0 "Army Officers are often the cornerstone of the control of right-wing to far-right governments, as they tend to be in favor of a patriarchical, class-based form of society and tend to come from the upper and upper middle classes. Army Officers are in support of policies designed to defend the fatherland, especially conscription, even though it could be argued that most officers do not have national defense in mind as much as they do the continuation of their own political and social influence.\n\nArmy Officers favor reactionary and monarchical forms of government, but will work well under other ideological leaderships as long as they don't feel a threat to their social position."

They will also offer funds to hopeful industrial startups, hoping to weaken the major industrial companies that could otherwise rival the banks' economic influence. However, they will be so heavily opposed to the government interfering in their secret business that they will infiltrate all layers of public administration with their lobbyists, threatening shutdowns and economic recession to counter-act measurements that would support a large federal government."

While some may be convinced of a higher religious calling in their quest, most are primarily - if not exclusively - interested in financial profits for themselves. And nobody is able to predict how quick the loyal colonial administrators of today become the fathers of independence of tomorrow should the government at home not be to their liking after all."

As such, they are brutally opposed to atheism and secularism and all movements connected to these non-religious movements, especially communism."

 middle_class_businesses_desc:0 "The middle class is not as fond of the status quo as the very rich, but they can be content and loyal citizens as long as their concerns are not ignored. Middle class citizens tend to be interested in the securing of their civil rights, a partially progressive taxation policy and partial economic regulation by the government to prevent multinational monopolies.\n\nSmaller businesses are always threatened by industrial giants, which leads to them heavily lobbying in local elections to sway parliamentary opinion in their favor. On a federal level, small businesses ten to favor a civilian economy that is primarily designed to encourage economic growth; they are far less friendly to massive military spending and state-backed industrial giants, even if they are vital to national defense."
 military_industrialists:0 "Military Industrialists"
 military_industrialists_desc:0 "The interest group of 'military industrialism' is perhaps a bit more uniform than one might think when looking at the differing target groups that battleship manufacturer and mountaineer equippers cater to. Military Industrialists are united in their anti-pacifistic stance, despising both leftist intellectualism and right-wing attempts to form international committees based on religious similarities or joint colonial interests.\n\nThe military industrialists, sometimes called "the militarists" for short (even though that's a less precise term), are in favor of foreign intervention and the buildup of a strong homegrown military production base. They also often support civil initiatives to establish volunteer units for foreign conflicts, even if that is designed primarily to maximize profits and less so to help foreign peoples in peril. Politically speaking, even though one might associate them automatically with the more aggressive and warlike outlook of fascists and communists, the military industrials generally despise these fringe ideological groups due to their poor diplomatic performance and the overwhelming influence on the economy that fascistic and communist governments tend to desire.\n\nThey are however feared even by governments for their relentless crackdown on the interests of the civilian industry. These guys really don't want to see the civilian industrial base expanded, as every employee in a civilian company is one that is not working the assembly line in a military factory."

Some central thinkers of socialism have decisively shaped the ideology in the early and mid 19th Century, among them the Hessian Karl Marx and the Frenchman Charles Fourier. Beyond loose ties to these central minds, radical socialism is a highly diversified movement: The eastern European Bolshevik movement is far more militant than the southern European reformed marxists, whereas Central American "Populares" are another branch entirely."

 robber_barons_desc:0 "The term "Robber Barons" was initially exclusive to the United States and became popular in the 1870s. Since then, the term has been established firmly throughout the English-speaking world and has also been adopted into French and German as a loan word.\n\nA Robber Baron is an influential businessperson who is most unscrupulous in their ploys to further their own wealth and societal influence. In practice, Robber Barons are often involved with the production and export of natural resources, as involvement with the homegrown industrial sector means an involvement with the urban working class that would be more willing and able to unionize and resist than the agricultural peasants that are mass-employed on Robber Baron properties as cheap labor.\n\nEven among capitalists, Robber Barons are notable for their right-wing views, as they have little interest in a free market, instead favoring state capitalism of the Brazilian model. The Robber Barons will actively seek alliances with fascistic movements in the hopes of securing control of the state-backed monopoly in a fascistic society for themselves."

Even Prussia started taking parts of the Polish linguistic and cultural nations for itself, leading to the once mighty Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth becoming a fractured mess of former nation states now absorbed into surrounding great powers, mainly Russia.\n\nThe Russians had been forced to grant certain autonomy to Poland and Finland in the 'Poland-Finland Government Act' after the most recent Bolshevik insurgency, but this solution is far from final. The Polish people, opposed to both Russian imperialism and the encroachment of Russian Orthodox Christianity, are getting louder and louder in their demands for independence."

Getting these men out of their positions should be Sweden's first priority.\n\nThe overall current political climate in Sweden has been dubbed "The Stockholm Crisis" by the Norwegian press, a name that subsequently caught on around the world."

This political idea, which would be most accurately translated to English as 'multi-ethnic state', connects both the fear of a collapsing empire as well as the fear of granting more power to the non-German parts of said empire. The Austrian government is in a limbo."
