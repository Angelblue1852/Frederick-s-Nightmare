 OHI_expand_the_osc_desc:0 "The Ohio Steel Council is one of Ohio's most valuable business support organizations. Members on the OSC over the course of the year employ as many as 8% of all employees in the country - the steel industry must for the sake of national stability continue to prosper."
 OHI_modernize_the_factories:0 "Modernize the Factories"
 OHI_modernize_the_factories_desc:0 "Ohio's government first initiated a huge puge for industralization in the 1890s, about three decades after the United States had largely taken its own transition from an agricultural to a heavy industry society. Although Ohio was for a short time hailed as a secret industrial powerhouse, the economic desire for self-modernization did not develop properly due to the country's autarky."
 OHI_steelmaking_innovations:0 "Steelmaking Innovations"
 OHI_steelmaking_innovations_desc:0 "Iron and thus steel is Ohio's only economically viable resource. Due to the fact that our reserves are limited, creating large amounts of low-quality steel is not an option. We need to instead focus on creating the highest quality material we can - to then attract foreign investors to in turn at last increase our output after all."
 OHI_private_business_innovations:0 "Private Business Innovations"
 OHI_private_business_innovations_desc:0 "The royal government has not been interested in technological progress, rejecting it as the ugly byproduct of progressive liberalism. It is clear that to get the king to modernize the military and the economy, we will need to convince his cronies to do so to bypass the royal ego."

 OHI_the_new_king_desc:0 "George V was King of Ohio for a long time, but his health is declining and his reign might come to an end soon. His son, Edward, has in the past openly sympathized with various political ideologies, one of them Pan-Americanism, but another also British Monarchical Restoration. It remains to be seen what he chooses to do."
 OHI_reaffirm_the_royal_claims:0 "Reaffirm the Royal Claims"

 OHI_censor_the_press:0 "Censor the Press"
 OHI_censor_the_press_desc:0 "Ohio has in 1923 seen a liberalization of the press as part of a treaty with the United States. These changes should now be revoked, seeing as how our recent reaffirmation of our royal ambitions once more puts us on course of conflict with the USA."
 OHI_cancel_the_1827_agreement:0 "Cancel the Agreement of 1827"
 OHI_cancel_the_1827_agreement_desc:0 "The "1827 Agreement" was a handshake deal between France and then Grand Pretender William IV that Ohio would not pursue westwards expansion into Louisiana in exchange for assistance payments and military protection. France has signalled that our most recent actions are no longer congruent with our nations' agreement - perhaps it is better to cancel it outright."

Britannia rule the waves! Britons never, never, never shall be slaves! But subjects of the kings they shall be."

 OHI_republican_tendencies_desc:0 "When viewed rationally, the whole independence thing was never good for Ohio and its people. Perhaps, a republican transition government with an eventual application for integration into the neighboring United States is preferable."

 OHI_seek_proximity_to_france:0 "Seek Proximity to France"
 OHI_seek_proximity_to_france_desc:0 "Ohio originally came about because of a personal gift from the King of France to the exiled King of England and Scotland. The only reason the past U.S. administrations have chosen to not forcefully integrate the United States is simply that France stands by us. We cannot let go of this invaluable asset to our diplomatic position."
