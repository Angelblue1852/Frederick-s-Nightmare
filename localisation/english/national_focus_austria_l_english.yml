 AUS_approve_the_tyrol_plan:0 "Approve the Tyrol Plan"
 AUS_approve_the_tyrol_plan_desc:0 "The Austrian Empire is in constant economic peril due to overstretched nature of her various rebellious provinces. Kurt Schuschnigg, an ultranationalistic leader in the Tyrol province, has brought a proposal to our attention that would see to Tyrol becoming a new and improved source of natural resource production."
 AUS_reform_the_economy:0 "Reform the Economy"
 AUS_reform_the_economy_desc:0 "The Austrian economy can be described as 'stagnant' at best. The Austrian currency, the krone, has been losing value over the past decade, making it tougher to import goods while not having any significant impact on exports as Austria is not a great exporter. It is in Austria's inherent interest to reform the economy and to strengthen the currency."
 AUS_militarize_silesia:0 "Militarize Silesia"
 AUS_militarize_silesia_desc:0 "The region of Silesia is still claimed by Prussia to this day even though we crushed them so hard that they are mad about it to this day. Militarizing Silesia will enable us to secure a military advantage over the potential Prussian enemy."
 AUS_refine_the_tyrol_plan:0 "Refine the Tyrol Plan"
 AUS_refine_the_tyrol_plan_desc:0 "The Schuschnigg proposal is fine as a start, but does not go far enough when it comes to industrial development to immediately process the resources additionally produced. We can make amends to the plan to fix that."
 AUS_invest_in_salzburg:0 "Invest in Salzburg"
 AUS_invest_in_salzburg_desc:0 "Upper Austria is valuable as both a financial and trading region due to its adjacency to Bavaria, making it Austria's main gate into southern Germany. The city of Salzburg in particular has proven to be an important leg that the Austrian vehicle industry stands on."
 AUS_invest_in_vienna:0 "Invest in Vienna"
 AUS_invest_in_vienna_desc:0 "Lower Austria and the Vienna capital region are the industrial and economic center of the empire and is one of the few states that is actually committed and loyal to the maintenance of the empire."
 AUS_invest_in_silesia:0 "Invest in Silesia"
 AUS_invest_in_silesia_desc:0 "Silesia is incredibly valuable to Austria not only because of its considerable wealth in natural resources, but also because it is a German-speaking region well assimilated into the empire. However, many inhabitants - especially the protestants - still hold sympathies for Prussia even 170 years after Austria's victory in the Great War. Investing in Silesia's economy will remind the folks why Austria is best."
 AUS_the_south_tyrol_plan:0 "The South Tyrol Plan"
 AUS_the_south_tyrol_plan_desc:0 "Expanding the Schuschnigg plan into South Tyrol might anger the Italian government - or even multiple Italian governments -, but we cannot afford to lose these profits from South Tyrol."
 AUS_expand_the_autobahn:0 "Expand the Autobahn"
 AUS_expand_the_autobahn_desc:0 "Expanding the Austrian Autobahn system will allow us to more efficiently ship goods, services and persons across the country and into and out of the empire."
 AUS_build_fortress_grunberg:0 "Build Fortress Grünberg"
 AUS_build_fortress_grunberg_desc:0 "Building a massive military fort at Grünberg, the border town of Austrian Silesia, will annoy the Prussians - which is exactly why we should do it."
 AUS_reform_the_government:0 "Reform the Government"
 AUS_reform_the_government_desc:0 "The Austrian government is backwards and stopped from progress by the nature of the unpopular and unstable empire."
 AUS_befriend_france:0 "Befriend France"
 AUS_befriend_france_desc:0 "France had gone out of its way to immediately after the Great War of 1756 break its alliance with Austria and annex the Austrian Netherlands in the Belgian War. However, since French victory in said conflict, the two countries mostly enjoyed each other, mainly because they worked together to counter German and Italian nationalism in Berlin and Rome. France and Austria might have to rediscover their friendship."
 AUS_befriend_the_ottoman_empire:0 "Befriend the Ottoman Empire"
 AUS_befriend_the_ottoman_empire_desc:0 "Although Austria and the Ottoman Turks were at war several times the past few centuries, most recently in the Austro-Turkish War of 1881 when Austria forced the Ottomans to let Romania, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece go free, the absolutist and religiously radical multiethnic superstates have in the past few decades grown quite fond of each other. Austria and the Ottomans have a great future together."
 AUS_invite_french_intellectuals:0 "Invite French Intellectuals"
 AUS_invite_french_intellectuals_desc:0 "Austria for a long time restricted rational and scientific exchanges both on a subnational and an international level. Minority peoples especially have seen a brain drain of people leaving the country and going abroad - Dalmatian-born electrician Nikola Tesla and Krakow native Marie Curie have both gone abroad to France to continue their studies there. Maybe the French system is more beneficial than we gave it credit for previously."
 AUS_franco_austrian_trade_plan:0 "Franco-Austrian Trade Plan"
 AUS_franco_austrian_trade_plan_desc:0 "France has the most powerful economy on earth, and establishing a regular trade route both over land through Switzerland and across the sea from Istria to the Azure Coast will enable us to fight our economic stagnation with new profits and new business innovations."
 AUS_priests_and_muftis:0 "Priests and Muftis"
 AUS_priests_and_muftis_desc:0 "Roman Catholicism and Sunni Islam find themselves on similar religious baselines currently: The rightful traditional leaderships of both religions are threatened by heresy, unfaithfulness and especially atheism. Perhaps religious exchanges with the Ottoman Empire would inspire Austrian Catholic clergy to be less merciful with religious opposition."
 AUS_revoke_the_dollfuss_policy:0 "Revoke the Dollfuß Policy"
 AUS_revoke_the_dollfuss_policy_desc:0 "Engelbert Dollfuß served as Austrian ambassador to Greece between 1921 and 1934. During his tenure, Austria signed the 'Austro-Greek Friendship Treaty', at home known as the Dollfuß Policy. The treaty guaranteed Greece Austrian military assistance 'against any and all foreign threats', avoiding specifically naming Turkey while still being clearly Anti-Ottoman in nature. This policy needs to be rescinded."
 AUS_new_bureaucrats:0 "New Bureaucrats"
 AUS_new_bureaucrats_desc:0 "The bureaucracy of the Habsburg realm is almost legendary for its inefficiency. The recent rise of the "St Pölten school" of political thought has seen the advance of new diplomatic and socioadministrative ideas around liberal-conservative reformer Wilhelm Miklas. Miklas proposes the creation of a new central registry and recruitment mechanism for bureaucrats."
 AUS_reichs_und_bundesbank:0 "Reichs- und Bundesbank"
 AUS_reichs_und_bundesbank_desc:0 "The current "Habsburgerbank", which is tightly controlled by the ruling family and which has utterly mismanaged the krona up until this point, needs to be put under the supervision of a non-monarchical meritocratic body with new authorities and accountability duties. This new "Reichs- und Bundesbank" ('Imperial and Federal Bank') will serve as a new and more efficient central bank to control the currency and will also be able to compete as a private bank for individuals."
 AUS_anti_prussian_policy:0 "Anti-Prussian Policy"
 AUS_anti_prussian_policy_desc:0 "Prussia is the enemy of all Austrians. They attempt to be our rival both in the colonies and at the Silesian border. They try to fund subversive activity against the government. They are just generally unpleasant protestants. We should once more confirm to the world that anyone signing pacts with Berlin is our enemy just like Prussia is."
 AUS_reassure_the_danube_pact:0 "Reassure the Danube Pact"
 AUS_reassure_the_danube_pact_desc:0 "Our military partners in Dresden and Munich have been anxious that they have no space in a future that belongs to Austria and the Ottomans. That is not the case, We should reassure these governments in alliance with Austria of continued Austrian support."

 AUS_eliminate_the_wurttembergian_threat:0 "Eliminate the Württembergian Threat"
 AUS_eliminate_the_wurttembergian_threat_desc:0 "Württemberg has been a source of dangerous nationalistic sentiment on our very border - silencing Rosenberg's government will be vital to defeat the nationalists inside our own border."
 AUS_secure_the_pomeranian_corridor:0 "Secure the Pomeranian Corridor"
 AUS_secure_the_pomeranian_corridor_desc:0 "Securing an Austrian coastline on the North Sea would give us the ideal pretext to split the Prussian realm in two - and we know how much Frederick II and the other traitor kings hated that back in the day, causing them to wipe out Poland. Let's see them wipe out Austria after we take the backbone out of their territory."
 AUS_modernize_and_liberalize:0 "Modernize and Liberalize"
 AUS_modernize_and_liberalize_desc:0 "The empire's stagnation is caused by its social structure and will inevitably lead to utter and total collapse. If Austria fails to enact meaningful reform right now, it will stop being an empire in just a few decades."
 AUS_catholic_kulturkampf:0 "Catholic Kulturkampf"
 AUS_catholic_kulturkampf_desc:0 "WIP"
 AUS_create_the_czech_parliament:0 "Create the Czech Parliament"
 AUS_create_the_czech_parliament_desc:0 "Granting the Slavic population of Bohemia, or, as they call it, 'Czechia', a permanent local parliament with local representatives is only a small step, as similar institutions already exist in Bohemia, but are so far limited to German-speaking populations."
 AUS_create_the_hungarian_parliament:0 "Create the Hungarian Parliament"
 AUS_create_the_hungarian_parliament_desc:0 "The Hungarian people are perhaps the most important non-German ethnic group in the empire. Establishing a new parliament in Budapest might please them and give them a semblance of appeasement in regards to their status inside our empire."
 AUS_create_the_slovak_parliament:0 "Create the Slovak Parliament"
 AUS_create_the_slovak_parliament_desc:0 "The Slovaks are small in number, yet are very proud and hard-working - especially so if you consider they are Slavic. Some Slovakians have more recently grown more attached to Poland hoping that this would gain them a path towards independence under Polish flag - we need to counteract these movement by establishing a distinct and exclusive Slovak parliament in Pressburg - or, as the Slovaks call the city, Bratislava."
 AUS_create_the_yugoslav_parliament:0 "Create the Yugoslav Parliament"
 AUS_create_the_yugoslav_parliament_desc:0 "The concept of 'northern south Slavs' has more recently been the subject of exploration in science. These northern Yugoslavs are united by their catholic faith against their orthodox and islamic brothers that are living in non-Austrian territories. The Slovenians and Croatians, although linguistically distinct, can be forged into a united subunit that is loyal to the empire by granting them a parliamentary system. One of their houses of parliament shall be based in Laibach, the city called Ljubljana by the Slovenians, while the other will be located in Zagreb."
 AUS_invest_in_slovakian_mines:0 "Invest in Slovakian Mines"
 AUS_invest_in_slovakian_mines_desc:0 "To encourage Slovakia's representatives to endorse Austrian rule, the primary sector of the region should be heavily expanded. Slovakian workers at work in the region's steel industry will be loyal subjects of Vienna."
 AUS_industrial_growth_in_bohemia:0 "Industrial Growth in Bohemia"
 AUS_industrial_growth_in_bohemia_desc:0 "Getting the Czechs on board with a federal empire will require a massive investment campaign in Czech urban areas, especially Prague. Making contact with Czech business magnates like Edvard Beneš could garner popular support for Austria's claims in the area."
 AUS_anti_romanian_sentiment:0 "Anti-Romanian Sentiment"
 AUS_anti_romanian_sentiment_desc:0 "There is only one thing that Hungarians hate even more than they hate Austrians: Romanians. To get the Hungarians on board with Vienna's Danubian project, they need to be reassured that the areas with both Romanian and Hungarian populations will never fall within Romania's or Romanians' control. Assuring Budapest's control over these areas might sway the Hungarians."
 AUS_bribe_pavelic:0 "Bribe Pavelić"
 AUS_bribe_pavelic_desc:0 "The Slovenians and Croatians have united behind several key figures in personality cults. The Croatian nationalist leader Ante Pavelić especially has gained a large following among the more militant part of Croatia's population - a population that doesn't know about Pavelić's less than Christian affairs and embezzlement scandals. Maybe, Pavelić could be "convinced" to support collaboration."
 AUS_the_danube_confederation:0 "The Danube Confederation"
 AUS_the_danube_confederation_desc:0 "It is at last time to realize the reformists' visions of a 'United States of Greater Austria'. This "Danube Confederation" shall see an actually successful multiethnic state under one united and proud flag of democracy and liberty. Our main examples shall be France and California, both of which managed to unite large multiethnic states."
 AUS_enlist_non_german_commanders:0 "Enlist Non-German Commanders"
 AUS_enlist_non_german_commanders_desc:0 "After granting equal access to military ranks to our ethnic minorities, we should harvest some of the best commanders that peoples like the Hungarians and the Croatians have to offer. These men have so far been blocked from advancing further through the military ranks at the rank of colonel, but now they shall be elevated to the generalships they deserve."
 AUS_centralize_and_radicalize:0 "Centralize and Radicalize"
 AUS_centralize_and_radicalize_desc:0 "The future of the Austrian government must be one of increased political influence and an ever-tightened security net, even at the cost of civil rights. The empire is inherently connected to the Habsburg monarchy, implications that liberalization could fix our problems must be punished as treasonous. "
 AUS_build_the_grand_palace:0 "Build the Grand Palace"
 AUS_build_the_grand_palace_desc:0 "Constructing a massive and visually impressive palace to the honor of the Habsburg monarchy will remind our elites and our middle class that we still hold power in the country. People will call us extravagant or insecure - and we will laugh at them, because we are Austrians and they are idiots."
 AUS_eliminate_the_romanian_threat:0 "Eliminate the Romanian Threat"
 AUS_eliminate_the_romanian_threat_desc:0 "Romania has since the communist takeover been an ideologically unpredictable breeding ground for enemies of Austrian society on the empire's border. There is good evidence that the Romanian Uprising of 1925 was only possible because of logistical coordination and financial funding from Bucharest's rogue government. Austria needs to put an end to this threat."
 AUS_secure_lombardy:0 "Secure Lombardy"
 AUS_secure_lombardy_desc:0 "Northern Italy is a region rich of rivers and other waterways, and we could secure a strategically more viable position by advancing our armies to the western edge of Lombardy. Sure, it will require a war with Italy, but the Italian government is a bunch of dangerous enemies of civilization either way."
 AUS_germanic_supremacy:0 "Germanic Supremacy"
 AUS_germanic_supremacy_desc:0 "It is official: Austria failed to diversify its government and has not managed to make it more inclusive. The best thing we can do now is to write the oppression of ethnic minorities into law and to hope we can shoot dead any rebels that might rise against us."

 AUS_prove_alpine_dominance_desc:0 "WIP"
 AUS_proclaim_austria_hungary:0 "Proclaim Austria-Hungary"
 AUS_proclaim_austria_hungary_desc:0 "While our doctrine of ethnic supremacy over the slav is without a doubt correct, extending said doctrine from the Germanic people to include the Hungarians might resolve at least some of the ethnic conflict: Germans and Hungarians are connected by their mutual hatred of everyone else. That sounds like a fantastic basis to build a society on."

 AUS_develop_military_doctrines:0 "Develop Military Doctrines"
 AUS_develop_military_doctrines_desc:0 "The Austrian army's recruitment and education programs are severely outdated. The Prussians are beating us at doctrine, they are beating us at officers, they are beating us at everything. We don't win against Prussia anymore, folks, we almost never win.\nAustria needs new and innovative doctrines, and quickly."
 AUS_army_programs:0 "Army Programs"
 AUS_army_programs_desc:0 "General Alfred Jansa, the perhaps most reform-minded and modernistic of Austria's military commanders, has complained repeatedly about a lack of discipline in the force and a lack of public interest in the land-based troops of the Austrian imperial armed forces. He noted in 1934: "Austrian civilians are obsessed with the navy and with battleships and with a potential Austrian aircraft carrier. They have to be kidding. Our land army is completely out of date and these idiots dream of an aircraft carrier?!"
 AUS_expand_dalmatian_naval_bases:0 "Expand Dalmatian Naval Bases"
 AUS_expand_dalmatian_naval_bases_desc:0 "Hermann Boehm, one of Austria's finest and most notable naval commanders, has published an internal military paper regarding the readiness of Austrian strike forces in the Adriatic Sea. "Austria cannot match the strategic superiority of the position of the Italian states - should any of them ally with the French or the Ottomans, Austria's path into the Mediterranean will be permanently and decisively closed.""
 AUS_build_silesian_airfields:0 "Build Silesian Airfields"
 AUS_build_silesian_airfields_desc:0 "The Austrian air force has grown in importance in the empire's defensive schemes due to that land forces' relative ineffectiveness in a potential multi-front war, especially when forced to split between Serbia and Russia, both of whom are united in a military alliance."
 AUS_develop_the_infantry:0 "Develop the Infantry"
 AUS_develop_the_infantry_desc:0 "Military companies like Mauser have been competing with each other for the next big government contract with the Austrian military, as the current infantry armament is entirely unfit for the new era of warfare. Developing a new infantry rifle will be Austria's next big military endeavor, so we should probably start making friends among these big armament conglomerates to see who has the best offer for us."
 AUS_artillery_exercises:0 "Artillery Exercises"
 AUS_artillery_exercises_desc:0 "Austria's artillery howitzers are vastly out of date, with infantry experts Jansa and Schroth having passed the joint memorandum "Regarding the state of Austrian artillery forces" in 1929 in which they in parts mocked the Austrian military's indecisive purchasing policy regarding artillery pieces and Austria's apparant lack of commitment to the cause of creating a strong and well-equipped core infantry force in its army."
 AUS_build_convoy_ships:0 "Build Convoy Ships"
 AUS_build_convoy_ships_desc:0 "Emperor Franz Ferdinand always dreamt of possessing a strong navy, sharing his fascination for battleships and other impressive naval behemoths with his friend and distant relative Wilhelm II, King of Prussia (the friendship of the two monarchs despite their nations' bitter rivalry has been the subject of more than one conspiracy theory). However, Austria's vigor in creating a powerful fleet has unfortunately led to the merchant fleet being somewhat of a forgotten child of the empire - we need to quickly (and quietly) fix this embarassing misstep."
 AUS_develop_fighter_models:0 "Develop Fighter Models"
 AUS_develop_fighter_models_desc:0 "Several German states, including Prussia and Württemberg, have begun developing rather large aerial forces. Modernizing our air force, especially our fighters, will be invaluable to keeping up with our new rivals in the skies."
 AUS_develop_the_special_forces:0 "Develop the Special Forces"
 AUS_develop_the_special_forces_desc:0 "We mat several roadblocks will military forces based solely on land-based infantry units - both Italy and Prussia can hide behind rather well-defended borderlines and could potentially drag out a one-versus-one conflict against an Austrian attack. In a new military scenario that sees a Prussian-Italian alliance against Austria, codenamed 'Case Ferdinand', Austria would see itself quickly defeated - unless there were to be marines crossing the Adriatic and paratroopers striking into Prussia, forcing a quick and merciless double surrender. What a glorious idea!"
 AUS_tank_exercises:0 "Tank Exercises"
 AUS_tank_exercises_desc:0 "Heinz Guderian of Prussia has been repeatedly named as one of the most dangerous men in the world by Austrian intelligence officers. The reason is not Guderian's ugly face or his lack of manners or a proper bloodline, but instead his new and revolutionary thoughts on creating armored sub-forces within the Prussian army, acting independently from the Prussian infantry and striking into 'vulnerable hinterlands'. That this is a reference to Silesia and the rebellion-willing Slavic lands south of it is obvious. Austria will need her own tanks to counter the Prussian ones."
 AUS_modernize_austrian_battleships:0 "Modernize Austrian Battleships"
 AUS_modernize_austrian_battleships_desc:0 "To truly rule the seas, Austria will have to overcome any naval threat that might show itself, including the British, the French, the Italians, the Spanish, the Turks, maybe even the Prussians, Russians or Americans. To achieve such an impressive feat against any of these nations (or all of them at once!), Austria will need new and modern battleships."
 AUS_develop_bomber_models:0 "Develop Bomber Models"
 AUS_develop_bomber_models_desc:0 "Now that our new fighters will obviously secure Austria's rule of the skies for ever and ever, the Austrian air force now needs new and better models of planes that can use our aerial domination to drop death and destruction onto the cities of our enemies. Developing new bombers is our next big project."
