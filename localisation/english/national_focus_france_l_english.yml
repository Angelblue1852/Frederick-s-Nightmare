 FRA_the_future_of_france:0 "The Future of France"
 FRA_the_future_of_france_desc:0 "Everybody is unhappy with the current constitution that has remained largely unchanged since Louis XVIII, with only two amendments having been made since to give voting rights to colonials and women respectively. Louis XXI has repeatedly proposed a more liberal constitution, whereas the royalists want to make it more conservative and the socialists want to abolish the monarchy completely."
 FRA_strengthen_the_unions:0 "Strengthen the Unions"
 FRA_strengthen_the_unions_desc:0 "Even though labor unions had traditionally always been part of French society, several pieces of emergency legislation in 1934 and 1935 had restricted workers' rights (such as the right to strike) in order to stop the economic downturn. Now that the economy is stabilizing, we need to fulfill our promises to the workers to restore their central social standing."
 FRA_anti_fascist_legislation:0 "Anti-Fascist Legislation"
 FRA_anti_fascist_legislation_desc:0 "France suffered a major terrorist attack on December 3rd, 1935, when a fascistic splinter group aligned with Rosenbergian national socialism assassinated Albert F. Lebrun as well as 22 civilian bystanders with a bomb blast in a crowded Paris café. King Louis XXI, who had been a close friend of Lebrun, has since joined the communist and socialist voices demanding an anti-fascist crackdown through legislation."
 FRA_reform_the_national_employment_office:0 "Reform the National Employment Office"
 FRA_reform_the_national_employment_office_desc:0 "An economic recession struck France in 1931. Viewed initially as minor, it was made significantly worse as the value of the French franc broke in 1934, making it harder to buy vital imported goods like food. The government bureau designed to quickly put unemployed citizens back to any available job, the National Employment Office, is in dire need of a thorough reform in order to revitalize the economy."
 FRA_form_the_constitutional_reform_committee:0 "Form the Constitutional Reform Committee"
 FRA_form_the_constitutional_reform_committee_desc:0 "Due to royal support, even the monarchists have now joined the anti-fascist movement. It is now time to capitalize on the progress made against these fundamentally anti-French forces and to form a committee to in the future reshape the constitution - and it is imperative that both monarchists and communists take part in the process. It is the only way to legitimize the new constitution."
 FRA_remove_taxation_loopholes:0 "Remove Taxation Loopholes"
 FRA_remove_taxation_loopholes_desc:0 "Although the communists generally talk a lot of nonsense during their rants and raves about the evil capitalist society and the parasite king that presides over it, their complaint that the economy and especially the taxation system misses out on many much-needed profits thanks to the thousands of loopholes is valid. By tackling this, we will take a communist talking point away and make them more cooperative."
 FRA_create_the_emergency_preparation_bureau:0 "Create the Emergency Preparation Bureau"
 FRA_create_the_emergency_preparation_bureau_desc:0 "Recent aggressive initiatives by foreign powers have proven that France will need to act to defend itself and the freedom of the French people. Although the population is historically opposed to a draft, it is perhaps now time to get out of the comfort zone and to remind the world who the one and only standing superpower is."
 FRA_initiate_additional_economic_programs:0 "Initiate Additional Economic Programs"
 FRA_initiate_additional_economic_programs_desc:0 "The economic recession of 1931 and the currency crash of 1934 have left the French economy exhausted and the French population frustrated. The free market policies of the Jaurés administration, forced on them largely by their conservative coalition partners, have failed. A more interventionist stance in the economy is at last in order to get the French people back to work."
 FRA_expand_levasseur:0 "Expand Levasseur"
 FRA_expand_levasseur_desc:0 "Although initially an aircraft designer, the Levasseur family soon switched fields to join the field of rifle development. The Paris-based small arms manufacturer Levasseur will be an invaluable leg of our economy and our military effort if correctly unleashed."
 FRA_expand_peugeot:0 "Expand Peugeot"
 FRA_expand_peugeot_desc:0 "Peugeot is the only one of the 'big three' (next to Citroën and Renault) car makers that followed a government call to help the French army develop armored vehicles in 1926. Since then, Peugeot has been the leadership's best bet when looking for a contract partner to build new and improved tanks for the armed forces."
 FRA_expand_amiot:0 "Expand Amiot"
 FRA_expand_amiot_desc:0 "Amiot, which has defeated all other aspiring aircraft manufacturers during the 1920s to become the absolute number one, has since helped the French Army Air Force and subsequently the independent French Air Force (formed in 1930) to design her fighter and tactical bomber planes - even though Amiot has hinted that it could also provide Close Air Support and Strategic Bomber designs if necessary."
 FRA_reform_the_military:0 "Reform the Military"
 FRA_reform_the_military_desc:0 "Although the second largest standing army in the world (only behind China) as of January of 1936, the French military has been in a bad state for years now. Military spending is unpopular - because after all, he who rules the world does not need to spend money to maintain it, right? Wrong. The government is planning a massive reform and reconditioning program for both the army and the public's view of it."
 FRA_expand_the_armament_industry:0 "Expand the Armament Industry"
 FRA_expand_the_armament_industry_desc:0 "Although especially the socialists suspect 'the military-industrial complex' behind everything wrong with the world and behind every little corrupt part of every government on earth, it is hard to deny that the military-industrial complex is rather useful when you need to wage war to defend yourself. Perhaps it is time to ignore socialist complaints and to Make France Militaristic Again."
 FRA_reform_the_paris_officer_school:0 "Reform the Paris Officer School"
 FRA_reform_the_paris_officer_school_desc:0 "Although men like De Gaulle, Juin and De Tassigny have proven that France in fact still has several notable and talented commanders, we have to recognize that our military education system is rotten to the core. Let's send our generals back to school."
 FRA_expand_metropolitan_naval_bases:0 "Expand Metropolitan Naval Bases"
 FRA_expand_metropolitan_naval_bases_desc:0 "The naval force has several strategic weakspots around France, as a Spanish-Italian-British encirclement might seriously be a threat to our independence. We have to construct additional naval bases in the metropolitan areas to be less predictable - just in case."
 FRA_enact_conscription:0 "Enact Conscription"
 FRA_enact_conscription_desc:0 "Arise, children of the Fatherland,\nThe day of glory has arrived!\nAgainst us tyranny's\nBloody banner is raised!"
 FRA_draft_army_doctrines:0 "Draft Army Doctrines"
 FRA_draft_army_doctrines_desc:0 "The French army has remained fairly dominant in the European power structure, but it is recently clearly falling behind the highly specialized British and Prussian attempts at forming modernized armies around amphibious invasions and armored assaults respectively. The French army will need to develop its own military doctrine to stay competitive with its traditional rivals of history."
 FRA_draft_naval_doctrines:0 "Draft Naval Doctrines"
 FRA_draft_naval_doctrines_desc:0 "Jean-Pierre Esteva, one of France's longest serving admirals, has been with the La Royale since 1901, rising to the rank of admiral in 1909, becoming France's youngest ever admiral at 29 years old. He has also held several professorates at military naval academies, where he continues to preach that young people need to come with better naval doctrine - perhaps the old man is right?"
 FRA_accelerate_the_abrial_program:0 "Accelerate the Abrial Program"
 FRA_accelerate_the_abrial_program_desc:0 "Initially started in 1927, the Abrial Program, named for French admiral Jean-Marie Charles Abrial, is a three-step naval program to strengthen the French overseas fleet. Abrial A, the first step of the plan, is a comprehensive plan to renovate our light and heavy cruiser fleets."
 FRA_artillery_projects:0 "Artillery Projects"
 FRA_artillery_projects_desc:0 "Ever since the legendary general Napoleon Bonaparte, famous for both his military skill and his loyalty to the crown, defeated the various German and Dutch states in a massive military effort in the 1790s, artillery has been strictly associated with French military culture. But our models are out of date and our designers have gotten lazy. We need to make new artillery contracts with more modern companies."
 FRA_draft_air_doctrines:0 "Draft Air Doctrines"
 FRA_draft_air_doctrines_desc:0 "The French air force is a relatively young organization, and as such has not had the time to develop a deep doctrinal and educational base to stand on. Notable aerial leaders like Joseph-Édouard Barès have long demanded the air force get the same cultural and political respect that army and navy rightfully enjoy - and new doctrines are part of such considerations."
 FRA_expand_north_african_naval_bases:0 "Expand North African Naval Bases"
 FRA_expand_north_african_naval_bases_desc:0 "Countering the Spanish-Italian alliance has to remain one of our main political and military goals in order to preserve the peace. Doing so requires the threat of constant encirclement of any attempt of Spain and Italy to unite their fleets - and to do so, we need a constant and massive naval presence in Algeria and Tunisia."
 FRA_abrial_b:0 "Abrial B"
 FRA_abrial_b_desc:0 "The second step of the Abrial Program, now that the cruisers are ready, has to be to rejuvenate the naval battleship force. These massive behemoths are slow and easy to snipe by enemy bombers or submarines. Our battleship crews and the crews tasked with protecting them have to know what they are doing."
 FRA_force_national_cooperation:0 "Force National Cooperation"
 FRA_force_national_cooperation_desc:0 "French companies are in constant competition with each other, keeping secrets from the others in order to maintain a market advantage. In times like these, this practice needs to be temporarily ended."
 FRA_french_airfields:0 "French Airfields"
 FRA_french_airfields_desc:0 "To satisfy both military tacticians in general and the air force leaders specifically, we need to make sure that the French air force can operate wherever it might be needed in future conflicts. In such plans, it is of the utmost importance to first and foremost defend the motherland, metropolitan France."
 FRA_fortify_indochina:0 "Fortify Indochina"
 FRA_fortify_indochina_desc:0 "Our fortress at Saigon marks the most important part of the French colonial empire. After securing our interests against our Mediterranean rivals, it is also important to provide particularly our navy with the means to enforce French interests in South East Asia."
 FRA_abrial_c:0 "Abrial C"
 FRA_abrial_c_desc:0 "The third and final step of the Abrial Plan, Abrial C wishes to intensify the French navy's carrier research. France has committed to a fleet of aircraft carriers in order to counter the British one, and it is said that Spain, Italy, Sweden and the U.S. might pursue their own carrier dreams. France has to remain as far ahead as possible."
 FRA_colonial_airfields:0 "Colonial Airfields"
 FRA_colonial_airfields_desc:0 "WIP"
 FRA_create_the_laborde_program:0 "Create the Laborde Program"
 FRA_create_the_laborde_program_desc:0 "Jean de Laborde has constantly critisized the proposals of Admiral Abrial. De Laborde, a proponent of Dönitzism, the naval thought first proposed by Prussian admiral Karl Dönitz, believes that submarines must be the backbone of any future navy, as they double as military and civilian hunters and can survive both in wars where the own side is ahead and in those where the own side is behind on the high seas."
 FRA_call_the_grand_assembly:0 "Call the Grand Assembly"
 FRA_call_the_grand_assembly_desc:0 "The Federation is under threat! It is at last time to reform the constitution to rejuvenate France and to rejuvenate the fight for freedom. But what freedom will it be? Freedom for the French individual? Freedom to love the revolution? Freedom to love the king?"
 FRA_draft_a_republican_constitution:0 "Draft a Republican Constitution"
 FRA_draft_a_republican_constitution_desc:0 "'Let it be known that the monarch is not only a Jew, which already makes him a threat to the working class, but also an agent of the bueorgoise. He needs to go. A king can no longer have a place in the new constitution.'\n- Maurice Thorez -"

 FRA_draft_a_liberal_constitution_desc:0 "'We are proud of our flag, we are proud of our king, we are proud of our king. Let me counter Monsieur Petain by calling him out on his hipocrisy regarding the freedom that gave him the opportunity to talk here - and let me call Monsieur Thorez an antisemitic idiot. Our constitution must be free! Our country must be free!'\n- Édouard Daladier -"
 FRA_draft_a_reactionary_constitution:0 "Draft a Reactionary Constitution"
 FRA_draft_a_reactionary_constitution_desc:0 "'The fact that we stand here under the same roof with communists who want to destroy everything that makes our country the greatest on earth just goes to show how much this "freedom" everyone talks about has failed us. Down with the parliament! Down with the communists! Long live the king!'\n- Louis Rollin -"
 FRA_pass_redistribution_laws:0 "Pass Redistribution Laws"
 FRA_pass_redistribution_laws_desc:0 "The disparity in France that opened up between the wealthy and the poor classes is infamous if not legendary. We must start countering the evil influences of capitalism as soon as we can."

 FRA_join_the_barcelona_agreement:0 "Join the Barcelona Agreement"
 FRA_join_the_barcelona_agreement_desc:0 "The Italian and Spanish communists have formed the Barcelona Agreement with the initial thought to counter the reactionary capitalism of the former French regime. Now that France has thrown off the shackles of class warfare, we should offer not only our apologies for the former conflict but also our assistance for the final struggle of the classes that is to come very soon."
 FRA_ally_portugal:0 "Ally Portugal"
 FRA_ally_portugal_desc:0 "Portugal has been wrecked by fears of communist takeover for decades at this point. Spain as the main threat to both France and Portugal has posed a powerful impetus to Lisbon to remain somewhat close to France even during more liberal times. Now that these leftist moods are off the table, it might just be time to formalize the friendship between the great French and Portuguese autocracies."

 FRA_anti_communist_crusade_desc:0 "Every truly conservative politician agrees that the continued existance of communist thought is a threat to mankind and, even worse, a threat to France. People like Flandin, Rollin, Petain and Roy have long recognized that the final struggle for the survival of French culture will be one in which the civilized nations face off against the communist ones."
 FRA_reassure_the_entente:0 "Reassure the Entente"
 FRA_reassure_the_entente_desc:0 "Let it be known far and wide that the Frenchman's most valued possession is his honor and his steadfastness. France shall never abandon those it pledges to protects and will not forget those who offer France their friendship. The French nation will never abandon its Entente allies!"
 FRA_turn_over_st_pierre:0 "Turn over St Pierre"
 FRA_turn_over_st_pierre_desc:0 "The 2nd Act of Autonomy of 1911 saw the passing of the entire territory of French North America that had not been granted to Louisiana or the American Natives into the hands of the Quebec government - on the condition that St Pierre and Miquelon would be leased to the French government until 1941. The navy no longer needs the territory - let's just give the territory back early."
 FRA_entente_attaches:0 "Entente Attachés"
 FRA_entente_attaches_desc:0 "Simply making pledges of allegiances will not be enough - France needs allies that come even somewhat close to being her equal. Our attachés shall watch over our allies' technological and military progress and send back to us regular reports on their performance."
 FRA_claudel_plan:0 "Claudel Plan"
 FRA_claudel_plan_desc:0 "Paul Claudel is a diplomatic and strategic thinker who sees the main threat to French sovereignity and European freedom not in the German states to the east, but in Britain to the north. Claudel proposes to settle the territorial unrest at the Rhine by returning the western bank of the river to the Netherlands, Westphalia and Hesse - in return of Entente membership."
 FRA_maginot_plan:0 "Maginot Plan"
 FRA_maginot_plan_desc:0 "André Maginot, only recently deceased, was mainly concerned with the German threat to French supremacy that constantly looms on our eastern border. Maginot has outlined two central ideas: Fortify the Rhine's west bank for defensive purposes and reintegrate Sweden into the Entente in order to surround the Germans."
 FRA_invite_ireland:0 "Invite Ireland"
 FRA_invite_ireland_desc:0 "'To counter the Rosbif is to counter his naval mobility', Claudel has noted in a written memo to parliament. 'The main strength of the Englishman is his united coastline as opposed to France's two separate naval frontiers. The Rosbif can use stronger and more mobile naval units than we can - thus he needs to be constrained and threatened. Norway or Ireland would both work fine as future partners.'"
 FRA_invite_sweden:0 "Invite Sweden"
 FRA_invite_sweden_desc:0 "In order to realize the Maginot Plan, we need to reintroduce the Swede into our alliance compact. Our partnership has broken once before due to the Swedish-Spanish War, of which we disapproved. Alas, let bygones be bygones! Sweden must be returned back to the French glorious system!"
 FRA_invite_greece:0 "Invite Greece"
 FRA_invite_greece_desc:0 "Greece must be the southern masterpiece of our strategic encirclement of our enemies. Effectively countering the Italian threat as well as reminding the Turk who's boss, an introduction of the Greek naval force into the united Entente navies would be greatest, most decisive blow to our enemy's strategy."
