 SWE_armen_reform_desc:0 "Driven ahead by Alexander Spräckarn, the youngest chief of the Swedish general staff ever, a new and fresh generation of Swedish army commanders is actively pushing for military reform. The Swedish armed forces are too driven by close-minded military conservatism as according to these young upstarts, and they seek to actively end the focus that the Swedish leadership currently grants to infantry units."

 SWE_endorse_the_fraus_plan_desc:0 "Fraus Varäna became First Servant (president of parliament) of Sweden in 1934 and has since tirelessly held rallies and meetings regarding the ongoing legislative stagnation. Seeing the main threat to Sweden in the rights of the lutheran church, Varäna advocates policies publically dubbed the "Fraus Plan", wherein the various clergymen and politicians accused of misconduct would undergo investigation."
 SWE_anti_corruption_efforts:0 "Anti-Corruption Efforts"
 SWE_anti_corruption_efforts_desc:0 "Nothing feeds political stagnation quite like corruption and bribery. A conglomerate of lutheran clergymen, Russian businesspeople and foreign secret agents (both France and Britain have been found to operate spies in Sweden in the past decade) have the joint goal of keeping Sweden a lame duck, primarily through bribing government officials."

Apparantly, the Bramstorp administration is worried what will come of it should the King be found guilty of corruption. Either way, the Prime Minister needs to go - if the King is guilty, the PM's judgement will be revealed as misguided, and if the King is innocent, the PM's caution will be viewed as treason."
